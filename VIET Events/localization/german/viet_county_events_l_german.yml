 VIETmisc.3000.desc:0 "Certain kinds of edible berries from [county.GetNameNoTier] have gained a positive reputation around parts of the region for their supposed medicinal properties. They are being shipped out in greater numbers to neighboring areas as a result, bolstering the local economy."

 VIETmisc.3001.t:0 "A Fascinating Cave"
 VIETmisc.3001.desc:0 "A few days ago, herders discovered a small cave in [county.GetNameNoTier]. Inside, they found several trinkets that would otherwise be of little value, such as wooden utensils and a few carved stones. There were even fragments of bones from an unidentified creature.\n\nAlthough the cave does not have anything of note, it was clearly inhabited sometime ago, or at least used as a stopping point for travelers or nomads. Its discovery has caused quite a sensation, with several locals scouring it to see what little things they could find in it for amusement."
 VIETmisc.3001.a:0 "And how is this news of any consequence to me?"
 VIETmisc.3001.b:0 "Send servants to collect some trinkets for me too."
 VIETmisc.3001.c:0 "We should erect a small [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] shrine in the cave."
 VIETmisc.3002.t:0 "The Good Captain"
 VIETmisc.3002.desc:0 "A garrison captain of a major fort in [county.GetNameNoTier], named [captain.GetFullName], has gained the admiration of many for [captain.GetHerHis] kind and righteous nature. For instance, [captain.GetSheHe] disciplines [captain.GetHerHis] men to be polite and helpful to the locals, and harshly punishes any guards who use their station to bully others, yet this inspires even more loyalty in [captain.GetHerHis] impressed underlings than resentment. Furthermore, [captain.GetSheHe] has done much work defeating several bandit gangs in the area, and is rumored to even have the grudging respect of these ruffians for being a worthy opponent.\n\nI am considering bringing [captain.GetHerHim] to my court - a charismatic, upstanding soldier like that could be of great use, helping whip some of my forces into shape. On the other hand, maybe I should let [captain.GetHerHim] keep [captain.GetHerHis] current post, as [captain.GetSheHe] is doing a good job there."
 VIETmisc.3002.a:0 "I need a soldier like that in my employ. Invite [captain.GetHerHim] to my court!"
 VIETmisc.3002.b:0 "The people need [captain.GetHerHim] more. Let [captain.GetHerHim] stay there."
 VIETmisc.3002.c:0 "Grant [county.GetNameNoTier] to [captain.GetHerHim] - a good [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord] will lead the community well."
 VIETmisc.3003.t:0 "The Rogues"
 VIETmisc.3003.desc:0 "Alarming news from [county.GetNameNoTier]! A small group of bandits have been going around posing as my soldiers to take people's money and possessions.\n\nThe odd thing is, they don't use the usual crude intimidation methods one would expect from a typical bandit. Instead, they pretend to be agents sent on important missions to secure peace in the region but need aid from the locals. Targeting the elderly, gullible, and moronic, they con them of their wealth without much coercion. Their operations went undetected for some time precisely because they did not usually physically harm others, and some of their victims were too embarrassed to admit what happened."
 VIETmisc.3003.a:0 "I'll let the local officials decide how to handle them."
 VIETmisc.3003.b:0 "Brutes or not, they're still criminals - arrest them!"
 VIETmisc.3003.c:0 "Intriguing. Are they willing to work for me? They seem useful."
 VIETmisc.3004.t:0 "The Doorway"
 VIETmisc.3004.desc:0 "Weeks ago, a most bizarre stone structure was found in the wilderness of [county.GetNameNoTier]. Those who saw it claim that this structure is shaped somewhat like some kind of gate.\n\nI sent a couple officials to investigate the situation, and in their report, they confirmed that indeed, this large stone - as high as a tall man - resembles the arch of a door. Some peasants had tried to move the stone previously to make use of its material in local construction projects, but the stone would not budge. Furthermore, some people now believe that it might be a portal to another realm - whether a fearsome one full of demons and other horrors, or some heavenly paradise, they do not know, but there is growing apprehension in the community."
 VIETmisc.3004.a:0 "Big stones lie around all over the place. Leave it be for now."
 VIETmisc.3004.b:0 "To put people at ease, assign some local guards to be there."
 VIETmisc.3005.t:0 "Boiling Point"
 VIETmisc.3005.desc:0 "A town in [county.GetNameNoTier] is the recent scene of some unfortunate happenings. There has been heated debate about a local issue in one larger town that is too irrelevant for my attention, but it was contentious enough that two people present at a recent meeting of various notables came to blows over it. A brawl eventually broke out, causing a great scene, and resulting in many injuries.\n\nTensions are reaching a boiling point in the town, and it may be necessary for me to intervene as the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName] who has supreme jurisdiction over the area."
 VIETmisc.3005.a:0 "The issue is irrelevant to begin with, so it's not worth my time."
 VIETmisc.3005.b:0 "I'll attempt to mediate some negotiations between both sides."

 VIETmisc.3005.toast_bad:0 "Chaos erupts, and a feud begins!"
 VIETmisc.3006.t:0 "Fiery"
 VIETmisc.3006.desc:0 "A major fire recently swept through a large town in [county.GetNameNoTier]. It has nevertheless devastated much of the settlement, and left many dead or injured. Given the town was of regional importance, this disaster could have long-time consequences."
 VIETmisc.3006.a:0 "Do what we can to aid the survivors and help rebuild."
 VIETmisc.3006.b:0 "I'm sure the commoners will figure out how to endure."
 VIETmisc.3007.t:0 "The Zone of Death"
 VIETmisc.3007.desc:0 "An area in [county.GetNameNoTier] that lies between two small villages, and is half a day's journey from one end to the other, has been notoriously known in local folklore as the "zone of death," among other unflattering names. It is said that there are dark energies in this area that cause many unfortunate incidents. For instance, there are stories of unwary travelers passing through who drink the water or eat the food from there, only to be cursed with sicknesses unrecognizable to our doctors that cause them to die weeks later.\n\nMany of us outsiders have paid little heed to such stories, as there are plenty of mysterious and dangerous places around the world, after all. But the rumors are now spreading, and even some merchants from afar avoid that area."
 VIETmisc.3007.a:0 "I should make sure to avoid traveling there myself."
 VIETmisc.3007.b:0 "I question whether it's really cursed, but who knows?"
 VIETmisc.3008.t:0 "The Mysterious Relic"
 VIETmisc.3008.desc:0 "I've received a strange report from one of my officials stationed in a village in a distant corner of [county.GetNameNoTier]. Several weeks ago, loud noises were reported one night; it sounded like blacksmiths at work, or carpenters building houses, yet no such activity was being done, to anyone's knowledge.\n\nThat morning, my official went with the locals to investigate the source of the noise; all they saw were a few fallen trees and odd clumps of dirt on the ground… and a rod made of some kind of wood. When touched, it emitted a loud sound that temporarily deafened all who were present, and a great light appeared for a brief moment. No one has been able to make the rod do that again, despite repeated efforts.\n\nThe peasants believe that the rod a holy relic from [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.CreatorName], but my official, a scholar, is more skeptical, as the report concludes: "I have no doubt [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.CreatorName] would never leave divine artifacts lying around like trash. After all, [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.CreatorSheHe] would surely prefer we study and learn from this strange thing to further our knowledge of natural phenomena about the world [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.CreatorSheHe] created.""
 VIETmisc.3008.a:0 "The peasants will be happy if we consecrate the holy relic."
 VIETmisc.3008.b:0 "It would be a worthy endeavor to let local scholars study it!"
 VIETmisc.3009.t:0 "Missing Persons in [county.GetNameNoTier]"
 VIETmisc.3009.desc:0 "Commoners living in [county.GetNameNoTier] stumbled on something strange not too long ago: an entire trading caravan. That is, the caravan itself was fine - the pack animals, trade goods, food and supplies, and so on were there, but the people of that caravan were not. The caravan members - merchants, porters, mercenary escorts, camp followers, and so on - were last seen leaving one of the nearby villages several weeks beforehand, so they couldn't have traveled far.\n\nWhen several of my guards and officials living searched for the missing persons, no other traces of them could be found. How did they just vanish all of a sudden like that? There are theories blaming everything from bandits to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilName], but we do need to figure out what to do with the goods and animals just sitting around doing nothing."
 VIETmisc.3009.a:0 "Just give the leftover supplies to some locals."
 VIETmisc.3009.b:0 "Sell the supplies to whatever merchants you find."
 VIETmisc.3010.t:0 "Lovely Pottery"
 VIETmisc.3010.desc:0 "Ceramics made in [county.GetNameNoTier] have recently become something of a fad in other lands, and they are selling for higher prices. A number of merchants have flocked to the area to expand their business opportunities there, and this is helping the local economy boom."
 VIETmisc.3010.a:0 "Great to hear!"
 VIETmisc.3011.t:0 "Casting a Shadow Over [county.GetNameNoTier]"
 VIETmisc.3011.desc:0 "A dark cloud was seen hovering around [county.GetNameNoTier] recently in a manner that locals described as unnatural and bizarre. It stayed in one exact spot for days on end (so they claim), casting an unwelcome shadow near one village in particular. Though the cloud has since dispersed, some claim the presence of such an omen spells doom and gloom for us, and dark times are soon to come, but I am not so sure how valid such claims are."
 VIETmisc.3011.a:0 "I'll pray to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] to guide us in these troubled times."
 VIETmisc.3011.b:0 "I'm sure it is nothing at all and just a strange cloud…."
 VIETmisc.3012.t:0 "Bad Officers"
 VIETmisc.3012.desc:0 "I have been receiving an increasing amount of reports about the brutality of my military officers who lead troops stationed in [county.GetNameNoTier]. While they generally do not terrorize the populace, they do not treat the troops serving under them very well. I have heard that it's gotten bad enough that some of the grunts claim they would rather serve under [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilName] than their commanders, as [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilSheHe] would surely be more merciful! As a result, desertions are widespread and the morale of the remaining soldiers are low.\n\nI could bring in new commanders. However, it might be politically awkward, given some of the current commanders have connections elsewhere and are of some social standing and influence, so they might cause some ruckus if removed from their positions."
 VIETmisc.3012.a:0 "This is not an issue I have time to worry about, alas."
 VIETmisc.3012.b:0 "Replace some commanders if possible. The politics of it is irrelevant."
 VIETmisc.3013.t:0 "Not in Vain"
 VIETmisc.3013.desc:0 "A bandit cartel had been terrorizing [county.GetNameNoTier] for a while now, and my forces stationed there have had trouble countering them effectively. Recently, one of the guard captains there was even assassinated by a spy working for these criminals. It was meant to be a major blow to my troops, given this captain's charisma, diligence, good relations with the local community. Yet, this had the opposite effect than what the bandits intended.\n\nThe assassinated commander, beloved by many, has become a martyr. Thus, my troops and other local commoners, spurred on by bloodlust to avenge the captain, redoubled their efforts to crush the bandit gang. Scores of bandits have been killed in the past few weeks, including many of their leaders, and their influence is greatly reduced, perhaps permanently. There were even rumors that the spirit of the commander assisted them from the afterlife."
 VIETmisc.3013.a:0 "It's bittersweet, but at least the bandits are defeated."
 VIETmisc.3013.b:0 "I will honor the commander with a monument."
 VIETmisc.3014.t:0 "The Legendary Mound of [county.GetNameNoTier]"
 VIETmisc.3014.desc:0 "For centuries, a small hill in [county.GetNameNoTier] was long believed to be some kind of burial mound or the final resting place of a long-gone, legendary figure. Who this figure was, how they got buried there, varies greatly depending on who you ask. Some say it is the tomb of a great warrior who died defending their hometown against a monster or invading horde. Others say it is one of a holy man or woman who performed miracles. Yet others claim it is one for a revered ancestral monarch who was a just ruler.\n\nRegardless of who it was (if someone is even buried there), [mound_tourist.GetTitledFirstName] has recently taken an interest in this hill after visiting it. Now, [mound_tourist.GetSheHe] has suggested that I spend some funds to erect a small shrine on the hill, where locals can pay their respects. The question is, who do #italic I#! think is buried there and would they deserve such an honor?"
 VIETmisc.3014.a:0 "It's pointless. We don't know who's buried there or if there's even a tomb!"
 VIETmisc.3014.b:0 "A warrior must be buried there. A shrine will inspire the local garrison."
 VIETmisc.3014.c:0 "A [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] must be buried there. A shrine will honor them and [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]."
 VIETmisc.3014.d:0 "An ancient monarch must be buried there. A shrine will celebrate our history."

 VIETmisc.3015.b:0 "We should take steps to curb their excesses."
 VIETmisc.3016.t:0 "Incorruptible Officials of [county.GetNameNoTier]"
 VIETmisc.3016.desc:0 "The officials of [county.GetNameNoTier] have gained a reputation for being honest and incorruptible, focusing on what is good for the community, and not their own interests. Whether such an assessment is accurate or not, surely it reflects on me and my administration."
 VIETmisc.3016.a:0 "Good! These officials set an example to us all."

 VIETmisc.3018.t:0 "Stonemasons of [county.GetNameNoTier]"

 VIETmisc.3019.t:0 "The Courtesan"
 VIETmisc.3019.desc:0 "There is a rather (in)famous courtesan named [hooker.GetFullName], who has settled down in [county.GetNameNoTier] where she plies her trade, so to speak. She is famous even in foreign lands for her talents and beauty, and it has helped enhance the mystique of [county.GetNameNoTier] to potential travelers.\n\nI had the opportunity to meet her when I visited the town she was staying at on some official business, as she was invited (by the host himself) to a feast I attended there. I must admit, she is a charming lady."
 VIETmisc.3019.a:0 "She is a cultured courtesan, after all, and not some random harlot."
 VIETmisc.3019.b:0 "I would pay for a memorable night with her if she's willing."

Currently, [traveler.GetSheHe] is serving the community as an important leader in one of the major towns. Today, [traveler.GetSheHe] is visiting my court, and based on our discussions so far, it appears [traveler.GetSheHe] retains a lot of knowledge about the various lands [traveler.GetSheHe] traveled in, and [traveler.GetSheHe] hopes to use it to assist [traveler.GetHerHis] town in growing and developing."

 VIETmisc.3022.desc:0 "There are rumors that a commoner girl from [county.GetNameNoTier] is said to be one of the most beautiful women in the world. She has many suitors, including men of very high status! Yet, if the rumors I've heard are to be trusted, she says she will one day marry a man who truly loves her, and her parents seem fine with indulging in her idealistic notions. At any rate, the fact that even a few suitors are wealthy and powerful men from afar has, amusingly enough, given the local economy a slight boost as they've been spending copious amounts of money locally."
 VIETmisc.3022.a:0 "That's nice to hear. I hope she'll find a good husband."
 VIETmisc.3022.b:0 "Sounds like silly gossip, so it's nothing I care about."

Her parents have never hosted someone so important before, but they try their best. The father is a craftsman and the mother a [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('lowly_servant_type')], and they make enough to afford the family a humble but comfortable life. Upon meeting the girl, named [beauty.GetFullName], I am shocked.\n\nTo say she is hideous is an absolute understatement. Upon further inquiry, I learned that the stories of her beauty were cruel rumors created by some bored local bullies, which spiraled out of control. Her family has been trying to put an end to such gossip, to no avail."
 VIETmisc.3023.desc.unpleasant:0 "\n\nThe girl is not much of a pleasant person. Years of being bullied by others for her looks, it seemed, has made her bitter, though I have to admit I find her self-deprecating humor amusing. She is skilled at housework and sharp, at least, and is eloquent despite her blunt speech."
 VIETmisc.3023.desc.pleasant:0 "\n\nThe girl, surprisingly, has a rather pleasant personality. It seems she tries her hardest to do good work at home.

 VIETmisc.3025.desc:0 "While on patrol in the wilderness of [county.GetNameNoTier], a couple of my soldiers discovered a small wayside shrine. What is odd about it, however, is that it is mostly submerged under one of the lakes in that region. My soldiers deigned it prudent to question some of the locals about this landmark, and they said it had always been there all these years. They had assumed it was a shrine of some sort to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] built by people who lived here generations ago that was abandoned once the waters of the lake got too high.\n\nAt any rate, I wonder if we might want to do a little engineering project, and move the shrine from its current location back onto land.

The only other thing of note in that spot were two trees by the tower, and a small, rotting wooden chest with nothing inside.\n\nIn the report I received, the local guard captain suggested we could renovate the tower to turn it into a watchpost, to assist with maintaining control over the region."

 VIETmisc.4007.t:0 "An Ending"
 VIETmisc.4007.desc:0 "In one of the larger villages of [county.GetNameNoTier], a respected elder recently passed away. He was beloved by all for his virtue and wisdom. As a community leader for many years, he had good relationship with many, and always strove to improve everyone's lives. Few had anything bad to say about him. His funeral attracted many who wished to pay their final respects, and some even claim that his spirit will provide the land with many blessings before he passes into the afterlife."
 VIETmisc.4007.a:0 "May his soul rest in peace."
 VIETmisc.4008.t:0 "The Grandmother of All"
 VIETmisc.4008.desc:0 "An old woman passed away in [county.GetNameNoTier] recently. Though a humble villager, this beloved "grandmother of all" lived a very long time, more than a century, some claim. She was of a kind and virtuous temperament, and was also quite sharp and assertive, as she did her best to guide the community. She even received visitors from even local nobles from other villages nearby seeking her wise insights. Regardless, there have already been claims that her spirit will bless these lands for many years to come."
 VIETmisc.4008.a:0 "This grandmother will be sorely missed."
 VIETmisc.4009.t:0 "Busy Spirits in [county.GetNameNoTier]"
 VIETmisc.4009.desc:0 "In several villages of [county.GetNameNoTier], there have been recent reports of strange groups of ghosts at night, wearing somber clothing. They are accompanied by bustling winds and a chill in the air; oddly, though, witnesses claimed these ghosts were otherwise harmless, and were preoccupied with engaging in mundane activities like chatting, enjoying food, singing, dancing, and playing various games - almost like as if there was a separate town of ghosts at night. Locals believe that, for whatever reason, these spirits of the dead are going to and fro and conducting various business.\n\nMore rational and reputable scholars and [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')], however, are skeptical about these claims and have not been able to verify them. They conclude this might just be either scattered instances of hallucinations, or merely some kind of prank devised by some bored but clever and resourceful youths."
 VIETmisc.4009.a:0 "I'm sure the ghosts were really there - beware!"
 VIETmisc.4009.b:0 "I agree it's likely a prank or a mass hallucination."
 VIETmisc.4010.t:0 "Slash and Kill"
 VIETmisc.4010.desc:0 "Several heinous murders were recently committed in [county.GetNameNoTier]; the victims' corpses were often found horrifically mutilated. Authorities were unable to find the perpetrator until the local guards devised a cunning ambush and caught the degenerate butcher.\n\nIt turns out that the murderer was a young nobleman whom everyone thought was friendly and kind! He cackled with glee as he lunged at the guards with a knife as they tried to arrest him. Thus, they were forced to kill him in self-defense. It seems he preferred to die rather than be caught alive and be brought to trial for his terrible crimes.\n\nHis family is cooperating in the subsequent investigation, and has disowned him posthumously, and many are praising the bravery and cunning of the guards. It was thanks to them that further tragedy was avoided."
 VIETmisc.4010.a:0 "To think such madmen exist! Thankfully it's over."
 VIETmisc.4010.b:0 "Reward the guards for their stalwart deeds."
 VIETmisc.4011.t:0 "Bad Timing in [county.GetNameNoTier]"
 VIETmisc.4011.desc:0 "The coincidental death of a number of important officials in [county.GetNameNoTier] around the same time has thrown the region into a bit of chaos, given the difficulties in securing reliable replacements for several positions at the same time. This will likely cause some disruptions to the local administration, but we can only hope it will be brief."
 VIETmisc.4011.a:0 "Unfortunate, but let's do our best. Life and death are unpredictable!"

 VIETmisc.4012.t:0 "The Official"
 VIETmisc.4012.desc:0 "A powerful local official in [county.GetNameNoTier] recently passed away. Given his prominence, and his reputation for being a just and kindly figure, many mourned the loss at first, until evidence of immense corruption was discovered among his belongings and documents, ranging from bribery to involvement in smuggling to abuses of local peasants like outright theft and assaults on peasant maids. The villain cunningly covered it all up under his benevolent facade.\n\nAfter all this came out and we learned of the mind-boggling magnitude of his corruption, it's certain the region will do much better without him!"
 VIETmisc.4012.a:0 "He fooled even me! If only we caught him while he was still alive."

He was kind and always offered spiritual teachings for any who requested it, though he refused all offerings of food, drink, or other luxuries. Now, news arrives that he has passed away while meditating - and yet, his corpse still sits upright, and does not decay at all.

Supposedly, he acquired his abilities after accidentally encountering otherworldly spirits, particularly a young, immortal woman who is now his servant (locals differ on why she serves him). They now travel the land fighting and exorcising demons and such supernatural threats, and according to local rumors, are currently in [county.GetNameNoTier] to take care of some evil spirits."

Many sightings have been reported along the cliffs by several coastal villages, and the stories were mostly consistent with each other: every evening, the faint trace of the ghost appears and stands looking at the sea, gazing into the waters for a few hours before disappearing. The ghost is not malevolent at all, and when approached, merely points, in an almost dreamlike manner, towards something which no one can see nor understand, before disappearing. Furthermore, a few villagers even claimed that the ghost has silently guided wayward travelers to safety.\n\nAnyways, the ghost has been nicknamed the "Forlorn Watchman" by locals.
