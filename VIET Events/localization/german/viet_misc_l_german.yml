He will provide the [ruler|E] with some sagely but oftentimes cryptic advice or thoughts, which will grant them a small boost to one of the five [skills|E].\n\nFor those who do not wish to encounter this figure, he will not appear if the #V Serious Events (Restricted)#! game rule is chosen at game start."
