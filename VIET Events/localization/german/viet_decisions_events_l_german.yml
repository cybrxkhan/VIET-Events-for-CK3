 # Events Related to Decisions
 VIETmisc.2001.t:0 "The Patissier"
 VIETmisc.2001.desc:0 "I have heard some interesting news today! It appears a famous patissier from the Middle East is in town. As a traveling merchant, he spends some time in one area selling his delicious desserts before journeying elsewhere. There are many who claim that this man’s desserts are unrivaled throughout the world!"
 VIETmisc.2001.a:0 "Perhaps I will pay him a visit sometime."
 VIETmisc.2001.tooltip:0 "For as long as you have the [GetModifier('VIET_traveling_baklava_merchant_in_town').GetNameWithTooltip] [character_modifier|E], you will have access to a [decision|E] to #V Visit the Famous Patissier#! to purchase these delicious desserts and gain further beneficial [character_modifiers|E]. You will also have access to a [character_interaction|E], #V Present Gift of Special Pastries#!. But be warned, he won't stick around forever, so if you are interested in buying his wares, best do it sooner than later!"
 VIETmisc.2002.t:0 "Delicious Desserts"
 VIETmisc.2002.desc:0 "“Welcome, my honored [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord],” the patissier says, bowing deeply. “I have brought a number of delicious delicacies from my homeland, all of which you will surely enjoy. Please, have a free sample as well. Now, would you be interested in buying any? It will surely be a delight for any feast or meal you have!”\n\n I look through all the desserts available today, and decide to buy..."
 VIETmisc.2002.a:0 "Baklava"
 VIETmisc.2002.b:0 "Lokma"
 VIETmisc.2002.c:0 "Kanafeh"
 VIETmisc.2002.d:0 "Halwa"
 VIETmisc.2002.e:0 "Qatayef"
 VIETmisc.2003.t:0 "The Patissier Leaves Town"
 VIETmisc.2003.desc:0 "The famous patissier from the Middle East who has been staying near my residence has sold most of his wares and is now leaving for parts unknown. Alas, one can only wonder when such a talented maker of delicious sweets will return to these lands!"
 VIETmisc.2003.a:0 "One can only wonder...."
 VIETmisc.2004.t:0 "The Spice Trader"
 VIETmisc.2004.desc:0 "The latest gossip around town has reached my ears - a famous peddler of spices has arrived in the area. Not only does he sell spices individually, but he also creates unique blends of these spices. There is one in particular, known as the “Five Spice Blend,” which is said to be peerless among the spice blends of the world. Though it might be more expensive than usual spices, perhaps I should consider buying this blend for my cooks to use before this peddler leaves town?"
 VIETmisc.2004.a:0 "I will consider this carefully."
 VIETmisc.2004.tooltip:0 "For as long as you have the [GetModifier('VIET_traveling_spice_merchant_in_town').GetNameWithTooltip] [character_modifier|E], you will have access to a [decision|E] to purchase his special #V Five Spice Blend#!, a unique and beneficial [character_modifier|E]. You will also have access to a [character_interaction|E], #V Present Gift of the Special Spice Blend#!. But be warned, he won't stick around forever, so if you are interested in buying his wares, best do it sooner than later!"
 VIETmisc.2005.t:0 "The Five Spice Blend"
 VIETmisc.2005.desc:0 "“Ah, welcome, welcome! I have been expecting you, [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstName],” the spice trader smiles. “Which of my spices are you interested in buying today? Or are you interested in my famous Five Spice Blend? I’ll tell you what… why don’t I let you sample some of the Five Spice Blend with some porridge, so you can see just how amazing it is.”\n\nI am skeptical, but try it nonetheless.\n\nHe’s right. It tastes amazing.\n\n“Interested in buying it now?” he asks."
 VIETmisc.2005.a:0 "Yes, please!"
 VIETmisc.2006.t:0 "The Spice Peddler Leaves Town"
 VIETmisc.2006.desc:0 "The famous spice trader who has been staying near my residence has decided to leave for elsewhere to sell his spices. Where is he headed off to? No one knows for sure."
 VIETmisc.2006.a:0 "Wherever he’s going, they’ll certainly appreciate his spices!"
 VIETmisc.2007.t:0 "Bad Luck... or Ghosts?"
 VIETmisc.2007.desc:0 "Something’s been off recently. I don’t mean the major events that have been happening around my life - what I mean is, on a smaller scale, a more mundane scale, I’ve felt as if things have not been going my way. It’s little things that stress me out like misplaced items, or how I seem to bite my tongue by accident a lot these days.\n\nA [ROOT.Char.Custom('MyPriestTitle')] I know happened to be staying in the area, and concluded that my spate of bad luck is caused by a ghost of some sort who has been following me around. If there is indeed a ghost, it’s hard to say whether it’s genuinely malevolent or benevolent and unaware of the harm it is causing me, but I was told it needs to be dealt with through an exorcism, if I am to be rid of its troubling influence."
 VIETmisc.2007.a:0 "I’m not sure about this… and yet, I might have to."
 VIETmisc.2007.tooltip:0 "If you wish to rid yourself of the [GetModifier('VIET_ghost_haunting').GetNameWithTooltip] [character_modifier|E], you may need to visit an exorcist by taking a [decision|E] to #V Exorcise the Ghost Following You#!. Then again, it might be unwise to provoke the spirits. And, of course, maybe there isn't any ghost to begin with, your misfortune is mere coincidence, and the [GetModifier('VIET_ghost_haunting').GetNameWithTooltip] [character_modifier|E] might disappear on its own. How will you proceed?"
 VIETmisc.2008.t:0 "It's Over?"
 VIETmisc.2008.desc:0 "For the past few years, my life has been plagued by all sorts of little misfortunes, which some claim to have been caused by a ghost haunting me, a ghost which I had refused to exorcise for whatever reason. Yet, recently, these little misfortunes have not been happening as often. Perhaps I am just getting used to it, or perhaps the supposed ghost is no longer bothering me. Perhaps I never needed to exorcise the spirit in the first place."
 VIETmisc.2008.a:0 "It feels odd, though…."
 VIETmisc.2009.t:0 "The Exorcist"
 VIETmisc.2009.desc:0 "I meet with the [ROOT.Char.Custom('MyPriestTitle')] who was recommended to me as an excellent exorcist. Of course, in exchange for such services, I must pay the exorcist a certain fee. One can only hope this ends well, though the exorcist tells me that we will have to patient before we see the results…."
 VIETmisc.2009.a:0 "Pay the standard fee"
 VIETmisc.2009.a.tooltip:0 "Hopefully, the exorcist will be #P successful#! in ridding me of the ghost, but then again, there is always the possibility that this will #N fail#! and backfire on me somehow…."
 VIETmisc.2009.b:0 "Pay a generous fee"
 VIETmisc.2009.b.tooltip:0 "If I pay the exorcist more than the usual fee, perhaps this will increase the chances they will be #P successful#! in ridding me of the ghost, but there is still a small chance they might #N fail#!."
 VIETmisc.2009.c:0 "Pay nothing at all"
 VIETmisc.2009.c.tooltip:0 "I am of noble blood, so I do not need to pay these exorcists at all - they should be honored they could serve someone like me! Then again, some say the exorcist might not bother trying to #P succeed#! with the exorcism, and might just let it #N fail#! on purpose…."
 VIETmisc.2010.t:0 "Fraud"
 VIETmisc.2010.desc:0 "Bad news! It turns out the exorcist I paid for was a fraud. After discussing it with some of my courtiers who seemed skeptical, we realized that I probably was never haunted by any ghost to begin with. The original [ROOT.Char.Custom('MyPriestTitle')] who warned me about it was perhaps deluded or misunderstood the situation, while this recent “exorcist” convinced us that my petty misfortunes could be resolved through paying him. While this doesn’t reflect well on me, at the least, it means I am not actually haunted by any ghosts…"
 VIETmisc.2010.a:0 "…right?"
 VIETmisc.2011.t:0 "Success"
 VIETmisc.2011.desc:0 "I was nervous about it all, but it seems like the exorcist did a proper job. Whatever the exorcist did, it worked.\n\nThings seem to be going better with my life now, as if the ghost was never really there to cause any sort of ruckus - assuming there was a ghost in the first place."
 VIETmisc.2011.a:0 "Surely, the ghost will never return… I hope."
 VIETmisc.2012.t:0 "Vengeance"
 VIETmisc.2012.desc:0 "Last night, I had a terrible dream. I met a hooded, dark figure, who accused me of all sorts of nasty things, before it turned into a horrifying monstrous figure with pools of blood where its eyes would have been, fangs dripping with pus, and a cackle that sent shivers down my spine! I was petrified as the figure told me: “You will regret trying to get rid of me! You think that exorcist could have done anything?”\n\nWhen I woke up, several of my servants were in my room, as they were trying to investigate what all the commotion was about. After I told them the dream that just transpired, they all laughed nervously. One of them said, quietly, “We all had the same nightmare last night.”\n\nThe next morning, I learned the exorcist was found mysteriously dead in their bed."
 VIETmisc.2012.a:0 "This… is all… a coincidence… right?"
 VIETmisc.2013.t:0 "Atonement"
 VIETmisc.2013.desc:0 "Last night, I had a strange dream. I met a person who was surrounded by a halo of light. Though I could not see their face, their calm demeanor and gentle voice indicated to me that this was a kind and compassionate person. I don’t recall much of what they told me in the dream, but what I do remember is them telling me, “I was lonely and merely wanted some company, so I apologize if I caused you any inconvenience. Before I go, let me atone by giving you this little blessing.”\n\nWhen I woke up, I felt at ease."
 VIETmisc.2013.a:0 "Could that have been the ghost?"
 VIETmisc.2014.t:0 "A Mysterious Bottle"
 VIETmisc.2014.desc:0 "Some of my soldiers recently found a small ruin not too far from where I live. Feeling the irresistible pull of adventure, I decided to accompany them after I gave them permission to explore the ruin to see if there was any loot of value. We did not find much, save for one small container. Inside it was a single bottle of wine, marked with only the symbol of the moon.\n\nWe are at a loss of what to do when one of the soldiers suggests taking it to the nearby villages and seeing if any of the locals know anything about it."
 VIETmisc.2014.a:0 "We can do that later this week when we find the time."
 VIETmisc.2015.t:0 "Shadowbanish Wine"
 VIETmisc.2015.desc:0 "We took the mysterious wine bottle to a nearby village to see if any of the locals knew anything about it. One of the elders, an old woman with poor eyesight, said she knew about it.\n\nAs she inspects the bottle, she says, “My eyes may not see well, but I recognize the symbol on this bottle. This is Shadowbanish Wine.”\n\nAfter I ask her to elaborate, the elder explains that as a little girl, her grandfather told her of an alchemist from generations ago who dabbled in alcohol-making. He learned a legendary recipe to create a wine that provided one with the power to easily peer through the darkness (such as at night) for a short time. Alas, the ingredients to make this wine were so rare, he only made a few bottles of this wine."
 VIETmisc.2015.a:0 "Sounds like a fanciful tale to me."
 VIETmisc.2016.t:0 "Shadowbanish Wine"
 VIETmisc.2016.desc:0 "“I thought my dear grandfather made it up until today,” the elder laughs. She offers to drink a bit of the wine to test it for me. She seems insistent, and says she’ll only take a sip.\n\nNot only is she fine after taking a sip, but it appears her eyes sparkle with renewed life. “My eyes can see so much better!” she says. “If my grandfather’s tales were true, the effects will only last for a short while, unfortunately, given I only took a sip. However, he said that if one were to drink most of the bottle, it should last for many days if not weeks. Ah! I forgot! Once the bottle is opened, its effects will only last for a while before it expire and is no longer effective - forgive me for forgetting to warn you. I hope you’ll use this wine when you need it most, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to see some things with my new eyes.”"
 VIETmisc.2016.a:0 "So it seems to work, after all…."
 VIETmisc.2016.tooltip:0 "You will keep the #V Shadowbanish Wine#! and have access to a [decision|E] to #V drink#! it at an opportune time, when you wish to make use of its miraculous powers - but you must take care to drink it before its effects expire."
 VIETmisc.2016.tooltip.haram:0 "On the other hand, as your [faith|E] frowns upon the consumption of alcohol, you can take an alternate [decision|E] to #V destroy#! the blasphemous drink instead."
 VIETmisc.2017.t:0 "My Eyes!"
 VIETmisc.2017.desc:0 "I was unsure if drinking this old wine would have any ill effects, but to my surprise, it had a pleasant, mildly sweet taste, as if it were water scented with fruits. More fascinatingly, the more of the wine I drank, the more something… seemed to change with my eyes. I could see everything more clearly!\n\nThat would have been impressive enough, but later that night, I understood the true power of this legendary wine. In the darkness, I could make out lights and shapes more accurately than I did before. These weren’t miraculous powers by any means, and well within the realm of normalcy, yet it was certain that my sense of vision had been heightened."
 VIETmisc.2017.desc.blind:0 "I was unsure if drinking this old wine would have any ill effects, not to mention the fact that I am blind, but to my surprise, it had a pleasant, mildly sweet taste, as if it were water scented with fruits. More fascinatingly, the more of the wine I drank, the more something… seemed to change with my eyes. My blindness wasn’t cured, sure, but I felt a strange and pleasant tingling around my eyes - they felt more relaxed than they had in a long while.\n\nLater that night, I understood the true power of this legendary wine. While I was as blind as ever, I could make out the faint outline of various lights and shapes - not enough that I could tell what was what, but even then I was amazed. I felt as if my other senses had been improved as well. Perhaps the wine, unable to enhance my vision, enhanced my other senses."
 VIETmisc.2017.a:0 "How sad this will only last so long, supposedly…."
 VIETmisc.2018.t:0 "Destroy the Bottle!"
 VIETmisc.2018.desc:0 "I and most of my courtiers have gathered by a small river outside. I hold the bottle of Shadowbanish Wine high, so that all can see it, before throwing it against a rock in the middle of the river. The wine bottle smashes into thousands and thousands of little shards, and the wine spills into the river, where it will be diluted. Some of my courtiers applaud me for my piety, while others shake their heads, disappointed I would waste such a legendary drink."
 VIETmisc.2018.a:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] will be pleased."
 VIETmisc.2019.t:0 "The Mysterious Wooden Chest"
 VIETmisc.2019.desc:0 "A few of my servants were helping my gardener the other day and doing some digging on my property when they encountered a most interesting find: a small, locked wooden chest, no larger than one’s forearm. Whoever buried this chest must have done so long ago, judging by its design. When I shook the chest slightly, we heard a faint clinking noise inside, indicating some sort of treasure must be there.\n\nThough we could not find the chest’s key anywhere, we tried unlocking it nevertheless, to no avail. We decided it was best not to do anything drastic like burning the wood away, lest we destroy whatever is inside the chest. We took it to some local locksmiths, but none of them could figure out how to unlock it, so I’ll need to find a skilled locksmith at some point if I am to open this chest successfully."
 VIETmisc.2019.a:0 "I’ll search for and find such a locksmith later."
 VIETmisc.2019.tooltip:0 "For as long as you have the [GetModifier('VIET_has_mysterious_chest').GetNameWithTooltip] [character_modifier|E], you will have access to a [decision|E] to #V Unlock the Mysterious Chest#!. However, it’s best to do it before you forget about it, and it ends up disappearing."
 VIETmisc.2020.t:0 "Opening the Chest"
 VIETmisc.2020.desc:0 "I’ve managed to find a locksmith of considerable renown, who many claim can unlock any chest. I bring him the mysterious chest, and though it takes him a while, he manages to successfully lockpick the chest.\n\n“My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord],” he says, “the honor of opening this chest is all yours.”\n\nWith shaking hands, I slowly open the chest, wondering what was inside it all this time: "
 VIETmisc.2020.desc.a:0 "nothing.\n\nNothing at all.\n\nIt turns out the chest was empty save for a few small rocks."
 VIETmisc.2020.desc.b:0 "a few gold and silver coins that look like they were minted centuries ago."
 VIETmisc.2020.desc.c:0 "a pile of coins and other precious gems and metals!"
 VIETmisc.2020.desc.d:0 "an old scroll, written in an unknown language, with several lovely pictures."
 VIETmisc.2020.desc.e:0 "a single golden flower, expertly crafted by a goldsmith from long ago."
 VIETmisc.2020.desc.f:0 "a single skull, of an unknown person who must have died a long time ago."
 VIETmisc.2020.desc.g:0 "several small [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] religious objects"
 VIETmisc.2020.a:0 "What a waste of time! All this effort just for this?"
 VIETmisc.2020.b:0 "An underwhelming result, but I won’t complain."
 VIETmisc.2020.c:0 "A good find, all said - the wait was worth it!"
 VIETmisc.2020.d:0 "How… enigmatic. Still, it might be worth studying."
 VIETmisc.2020.e:0 "Fascinating… just look at its beauty!"
 VIETmisc.2020.f:0 "Does... anyone else suddenly feel a chill in the air?"
 VIETmisc.2020.g:0 "Perhaps this is a sign from [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]?"
 VIETmisc.2021.t:0 "An Interesting Adventurer"
 VIETmisc.2021.desc:0 "I was at the local inn where I met an interesting man. At first, I thought he was a typical, grizzled mercenary. However, after talking with him some more, I learned that not only was he quite cultured and charming, he was actually trained as a scholar in a faraway land, before he decided to take up adventuring.\n\n“Versatility is the key to survival,” he says. “Hire me, and you'll be well prepared to face threats, both physical and of the mind. As I fight with both blade and pen, you might say I'm equipped to handle nearly any danger, even those that may not come in the form of overt violence.”\n\nHe says he will stay in the area for a short while before leaving for elsewhere, so if I want to hire him, I better do it soon."
 VIETmisc.2021.a:0 "I will consider your offer."
 VIETmisc.2021.tooltip:0 "For as long as you have the [GetModifier('VIET_mercenary_scholar_in_town').GetNameWithTooltip] [character_modifier|E], you will have access to a [decision|E] to #V hire#! him to be your bodyguard."
 VIETmisc.2022.t:0 "The Mercenary Scholar"
 VIETmisc.2022.desc:0 "To my relief, when I came to the same inn, the mercenary was still there. We negotiated a reasonable contract, whereupon he would serve me for ten years by my side. Once the deal was sealed, he laughed and told me, “What dangers and wonders shall we discover out there? I can hardly wait to find out! Just kidding. Hopefully, no dangers will come your way, [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstName]!”"
 VIETmisc.2022.a:0 "I hope so too."
 VIETmisc.2023.t:0 "Kidnapping!"
 VIETmisc.2023.desc:0 "A few of my loyal servants were traveling to a nearby town for official business on my behalf when they were attacked and taken hostage by a large gang of bandits! The bandits demand a sum of #V 100 gold#! to let my servants free. I will have one year to pay this ransom before they will kill my servants.\n\nMy servants are mere peasants, so it wouldn’t reflect too badly in the eyes of some of my courtiers if I simply leave my servants to their fate - that’s not to mention there is no guarantee the bandits will even honor the deal if I do pay the ransom. On the other hand, these are my loyal servants, so I will need a daring plan if I wish to rescue them; or, perhaps, it might be better to simply pay the ransom and hope things work out."
 VIETmisc.2023.a:0 "I must consider my options carefully."
 VIETmisc.2023.tooltip:0 "You now have access to a [decision|E] to #V ransom#! your servants or attempt to #V free the hostages#! by force. Though you are not obliged to take any action, it may reflect badly on you if you don’t; on the other hand, there is no guarantee the bandits will honor the deal. Either way, you will have one year to do something until the [GetModifier('VIET_servant_hostage_countdown').GetNameWithTooltip] [character_modifier|E] disappears and your servants are killed."
 VIETmisc.2024.t:0 "What to do?"
 VIETmisc.2024.desc:0 "My servants are still being held as hostages, but not for long! Action must be taken to save my servants. I discussed the matter with some of my advisors and guards, and they have laid out the arguments for and against paying the random versus attempting a daring rescue. In the end, I firmly decided that we will…"
 VIETmisc.2024.a:0 "Pay the bandits the ransom."
 VIETmisc.2024.a.tooltip:0 "You pay the bandits the @gold_icon! 100 they demanded in exchange for your servants' freedom. Be warned - there's a chance they could deceive you, depending on various factors such as your [traits|E], [skills|E], and [dread|E], among other things."
 VIETmisc.2024.b:0 "Attempt to rescue my servants!"
 VIETmisc.2024.b.tooltip:0 "You send your bravest and most cunning warriors to free the hostages by force while pretending to pay the ransom. The likelihood of success for this operation depends on your [martial|E], [intrigue|E], and other factors like your [traits|E]."
 VIETmisc.2025.t:0 "Ransom Paid"
 VIETmisc.2025.desc:0 "We left the chests full of gold at the agreed upon place, while the bandits let my servants go one by one. Thankfully, the whole exchange was peaceful if tense, and nothing happened. Per our agreement with the bandits, we did not pursue them, though I will be sure to notify my soldiers to be on the lookout for them in the future.\n\nMy servants are relieved to finally be home, and they thank me profusely for looking after them. Even if this whole incident does not reflect well on my ability to maintain peace and security within my territories, at the least, all in all, everything was resolved without anyone being hurt."
 VIETmisc.2025.a:0 "I was worried for a moment there!"
 VIETmisc.2026.t:0 "Ransom Increased"
 VIETmisc.2026.desc:0 "When we reached the agreed upon rendezvous site, the bandits notified us that we’d have to pay even more gold in exchange for my servants’ freedom: a total of #V 200 gold#!. If I do not provide this new amount of gold by sunset tomorrow, or else my servants would be killed at that time.\n\nI gnash my teeth as I glare at the bandits, several of whom have smug smiles on their faces. I have to make a decision now, as I don’t know what might happen if I wait too long."
 VIETmisc.2026.a:0 "Fine! We’ll pay the increased ransom as you demand."
 VIETmisc.2026.b:0 "Be reasonable! Let’s stick to the original amount we agreed to."
 VIETmisc.2026.c:0 "This is ridiculous. I refuse to negotiate any further."
 VIETmisc.2026.d:0 "Give us a moment to discuss this, if you don’t mind?"
 VIETmisc.2026.d.tooltip:0 "You don’t have much time, but you pull aside your trusted guard captain, and explain to him your plan. You and a couple of your officials will #V stall for time#! by trying to negotiate with the bandits, while this captain and a few soldiers will sneak around to #V secretly free the hostages#!. It’s a risky plan, and some fighting might occur, but it might work."
 VIETmisc.2027.t:0 "Last Minute Rescue"
 VIETmisc.2027.desc:0 "While I and my officials try to negotiate with the bandits to reduce the new ransom, a few of my guards sneak around to free the hostages. Some time later, we hear shouts from the bandits’ side, as they realize the hostages are being freed. Knowing we don’t have much time, I and my men suddenly make a run for it and fight our way out in the chaos.\n\nIn the end, while we did lose a few good soldiers and a couple of the hostages, everyone else made it out relatively unscathed. I will have to order my soldiers to hunt down these bandits soon, but today, my surviving servants can rest knowing that they are finally safe."
 VIETmisc.2027.a:0 "Let us honor those who sacrificed their lives for this, too."
 VIETmisc.2028.t:0 "Treachery!"
 VIETmisc.2028.desc:0 "When we left the chests of gold at the rendezvous point, per our agreement with the bandits, everything went smoothly at first. However, I sensed something wrong when it took them too long to release our servants. Things got heated when I demanded to know where my servants were.\n\nEarlier, I had sent a few scouts to scout ahead for any ambushes and such. They returned and whispered grave news into my ear - my servants were never going to be returned: they were already killed to the last person. The bandits just wanted to run off with our gold."
 VIETmisc.2028.a:0 "Those bastards will pay for their treachery!"
 VIETmisc.2029.t:0 "Failure"
 VIETmisc.2029.desc:0 "Although we agreed to meet the bandits at the rendezvous point, I also ordered a separate detachment of my soldiers to sneak around and rescue my servants while we distracted the bandits. Unfortunately, things did not go according to plan. The bandits got wind of what we were doing, or perhaps anticipated we would betray them. A battle ensued, and only a few of my servants managed to escape the chaos, while a good number of my soldiers died and most of the bandits escaped into the wilderness."
 VIETmisc.2029.a:0 "Curses!" 
 VIETmisc.2030.t:0 "Success... sort of?"
 VIETmisc.2030.desc:0 "Although we agreed to meet the bandits at the rendezvous point, I also ordered a separate detachment of my soldiers to sneak around and rescue my servants while we distracted the bandits. At first, things went according to plan. My soldiers managed to reach the hostages, and kill the bandits guarding them. However, once they started to escape, they must have made too much noise, and the bandits realized what was going on. A large fight broke out, and several of my servants and soldiers died, while many of the bandits escaped into the wilderness.\n\nStill, a decent number of my servants are free, so I cannot say it was an absolute failure. And, at the least, now we have a good idea on who these bandits are, and where they’re headed off."
 VIETmisc.2030.a:0 "Good work, soldiers, but we’ll have to hunt all those bandits down!"
 VIETmisc.2031.t:0 "Success!"
 VIETmisc.2031.desc:0 "Although we agreed to meet the bandits at the rendezvous point, I also ordered a separate detachment of my soldiers to sneak around and rescue my servants while we distracted the bandits. Things went exactly according to plan. As the bandits were being distracted, my soldiers reached the hostages, killed the bandits guarding them, and snuck out without raising the alarm.\n\nBy the time the bandits realized what was going on, it was too late for them, as they were completely surrounded by my men. They wisely decided to surrender, though they are mostly fated to be executed.\n\nMeanwhile, my servants thank me profusely for pulling off a daring but successful rescue. They are all safe and accounted for, thankfully."
 VIETmisc.2031.a:0 "Songs will be sung of our daring rescue one day!"
 VIETmisc.2032.t:0 "xxxxx"
 VIETmisc.2032.desc:0 "xxxxx"
 VIETmisc.2032.a:0 "xxxxx"
 VIETmisc.2033.t:0 "Deadline Passed"
 VIETmisc.2033.desc:0 "The deadline for me to pay the ransom to the bandits who kidnapped my servants has passed. However, I heard the most alarming news. It appears my servants, bitter at my lack of action, have decided to defect over to the bandits! My servants possess some knowledge of my property, as well as how my soldiers operate, so this could prove to be a dangerous problem for me in the near future as this information will be useful for the bandits and their criminal operations."
 VIETmisc.2033.a:0 "Well… at least my servants are still alive?"
 VIETmisc.2034.t:0 "Deadline Passed"
 VIETmisc.2034.desc:0 "The deadline for me to pay the ransom to the bandits who kidnapped my servants has passed. I have received word that my servants being held hostage by the bandits have all been killed. While I may have had my reasons for not paying the ransom, this might not reflect on me, particularly among the common folk."

 VIETmisc.2035.a:0 "xxxxx"
 VIETmisc.2036.t:0 "Bungled Escape Attempt"
 VIETmisc.2036.desc:0 "I heard.. interesting news today concerning the hostage situation with my servants. Before I could decide on what to do about that, it appears my servants tried to escape on their own. However, they bungled their attempt, and many of them were killed in the process.
