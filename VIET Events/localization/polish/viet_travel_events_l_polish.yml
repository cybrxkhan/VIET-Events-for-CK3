 VIETmisc.7001.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Food Gone Bad"
 VIETmisc.7001.desc:0 "While traveling on the road in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName], we discovered to our horror that a number of our food supplies had gone bad. It appears earlier in our trip, the food got mixed with a lot of water by accident, and is now rather moldy.\n\nThere aren't any settlements nearby, so we need to forage and hunt for some food to hold us over, though this will waste time. On the other hand, perhaps we could tough it out, ration out what food we still have, and hurry to the nearest settlements."
 VIETmisc.7001.a:0 "Let's take our time to forage and hunt."
 VIETmisc.7001.b:0 "We'll put up with smaller rations for now."
 VIETmisc.7002.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Helpful Locals"
 VIETmisc.7002.desc:0 "During my travels I came to a rather friendly village in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName]. The locals were respectful and kindly gave us supplies. A few members of my traveling caravan were suspicious, but nothing unusual happened."
 VIETmisc.7002.a:0 "Such nice people out there!"
 VIETmisc.7003.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ A Shortcut"
 VIETmisc.7003.desc:0 "Thanks to [master.GetHerHis] diligent efforts, my caravan master [master.GetTitledFirstName] found a safe shortcut in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName], which we could use to reduce the time of our journey by quite a bit. How fortunate!"
 VIETmisc.7003.a:0 "Good work!"
 VIETmisc.7004.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Leisure"
 VIETmisc.7004.desc:0 "We stopped by a town in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName] for a quick rest.\n\nThis town is known locally for its amenities and being a center of leisure, and several of the guards in my entourage got distracted by the pretty, local [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetCulture.GetName] girls. We need to go soon, but perhaps it wouldn't be a bad idea to rest some more…."
 VIETmisc.7004.a:0 "I wouldn't mind some fun with the locals."
 VIETmisc.7004.b:0 "We won't waste time on these frivolities!"
 VIETmisc.7005.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Wayside Shrine"
 VIETmisc.7005.desc:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName] is home to a famous wayside shrine that I happen to be passing by today.\n\nLocals tell us that it isn't uncommon for travelers to spend even a few days praying there, for it is said that doing so will ensure safe passage for one's journey.\n\nI am unsure how helpful praying at this site would be, but I should at least pay my respects to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] while here."
 VIETmisc.7005.a:0 "Say a quick prayer, then move on."
 VIETmisc.7005.b:0 "Spend several days in prayer."
 VIETmisc.7005.c:0 "Leave a small offering at the wayshrine."
 VIETmisc.7006.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Caravan Loot"
 VIETmisc.7006.desc:0 "We come across the remnants of a trading caravan in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName]. The arrow-ridden corpses of merchants, guards, and horses, overturned carriages, and ruined merchandise all point to this being some kind of attack by bandits.\n\nAnyways, such dangers on the road aren't unheard of. After we bury the dead, my traveling companions and I debate what should be done with the merchandise which the bandits did not carry off with them. Salvaging these items could be quite lucrative, though it will take some time."
 VIETmisc.7006.a:0 "We'll split the goods among ourselves."
 VIETmisc.7006.b:0 "I'll take the lion's share as is my right."
 VIETmisc.7006.c:0 "We shouldn't steal these from the dead."
 VIETmisc.7006.d:0 "Give it to the region's ruler, [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetTitle.GetDeJureLiege.GetHolder.GetFirstName]."
 VIETmisc.7007.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Local Tour"
 VIETmisc.7007.desc:0 "I am stopping by a town in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName] on my travels, and the locals have showered me with great esteem.\n\nThe people here did not expect someone like myself to visit their humble settlement, and some of the local leaders are suggesting that I spend a few days there. These leaders wish to show me around the area, and leave a good impression on me about their town and its surroundings as well as the people who dwell here."
 VIETmisc.7007.a:0 "Good! I don't mind a slight detour."
 VIETmisc.7007.b:0 "Alas, I have places to go to."
 VIETmisc.7008.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Oversleeping"
 VIETmisc.7008.desc:0 "Yesterday, our travels in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName] were rather grueling, and I was so exhausted that I overslept. The rest of my entourage didn’t want to wake me up, saying they worried that I would not be in the right state of mind if they didn’t give me enough time to rest."
 VIETmisc.7008.a:0 "I'll be careful not to oversleep again."
 VIETmisc.7008.b:0 "Thanks! Now #italic that#! was a good night’s rest."
 VIETmisc.7009.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ The Liar"
 VIETmisc.7009.desc:0 "When we set up camp for the night in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName], it so happened that a caravan of merchants was camping pretty close to us. They were traveling the opposite direction, and we exchanged some information about conditions on the road for our respective journeys.\n\nAnyhow, the merchants told me they met a most odd fellow several days ago, who went by the nickname of “The Liar.” He told them somewhat nonsensical advice that somehow… also made sense. They’re not sure what to make of him, but the veteran merchants says he is by far the oddest fellow they’ve ever met."
 VIETmisc.7009.a:0 "He sounds like an odd fellow."
 VIETmisc.7009.b:0 "You mean Qi Ma the Liar? I’ve met him."

 VIETmisc.7010.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Servant's Death"
 VIETmisc.7010.desc:0 "While traveling through [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName], one of my close servants passed away. Death from natural causes is not unheard of on these travels, but it is unfortunate nonetheless as the servant was close to me.\n\nRegardless, we have to decide what we will do with the body of the deceased. It would be improper to just dump their corpse on the side of the road, after all, even if they're a servant. We could instead take their body back home for a funeral."
 VIETmisc.7010.a:0 "Dump the corpse on the side of the road."
 VIETmisc.7010.b:0 "Give them a simple but proper burial here."
 VIETmisc.7010.c:0 "Bring them back with us – they deserve no less."
 VIETmisc.7011.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Animal Attack"
 VIETmisc.7011.desc:0 "Wild animals came to our camp last night while we were in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName]. No one was hurt, but they did ransack some of our food supplies."
 VIETmisc.7011.a:0 "We'll have to accept our losses."
 VIETmisc.7011.b:0 "Buy supplies from the locals."
 VIETmisc.7011.c:0 "Force locals to give us supplies."
 VIETmisc.7012.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Terrible Inn"
 VIETmisc.7012.desc:0 "The inn we stayed at in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName] last night was horrible to say the least. Something about the quality of its bedding and atmosphere did not sit well with many of us, myself included, when we tried to sleep last night. As we ride onwards today, everyone in my entourage is visibly tired and exhausted."
 VIETmisc.7012.a:0 "We'll have to bear with it."
 VIETmisc.7012.b:0 "Let's rest a few days at a better inn."
 VIETmisc.7013.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Amazing Inn"
 VIETmisc.7013.desc:0 "The inn we stayed at in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName] last night was a surprisingly wonderful place. I don't know what the inn or its staff did right, but something about the inn allowed most of us to sleep through the night so peacefully. This morning, there are smiles on the faces of many in my entourage as we prepare to leave."
 VIETmisc.7013.a:0 "What a wonderful place this was!"
 VIETmisc.7013.b:0 "Maybe we should stay a few more days…."
 VIETmisc.7014.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Argument"
 VIETmisc.7014.desc:0 "[traveler_1.GetTitledFirstName] and [traveler_2.GetTitledFirstName] have been arguing for several hours now as we trudge along the road. At this point, I don't even know how this idiotic argument started, and I'd rather not get involved. On the other hand, some of the others in the entourage are giving me these looks, silently telling me that as [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], I should do something."
 VIETmisc.7014.a:0 "I can’t believe people idealize traveling in large groups."
 VIETmisc.7014.b:0 "Maybe I can convince these two fools to shut up."
 VIETmisc.7014.b.success:0 "They agree to stop their silly argument"
 VIETmisc.7014.b.failure:0 "They ignore your pleas to stop the arguing"
 VIETmisc.7015.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Friendship"
 VIETmisc.7015.desc:0 "[traveler_1.GetTitledFirstName] and [traveler_2.GetTitledFirstName] have been chatting amicably now for many hours now as we continue on our trip. The two of them seem to be getting along really well with each other."
 VIETmisc.7015.a:0 "They're becoming fast friends!"
 VIETmisc.7016.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Muddy Roads"
 VIETmisc.7016.desc:0 "The region we're traveling through in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName] suffered from an unusual amount of rain recently. Though it has cleared, it has made the roads muddy. Most of it has been manageable, until today, when some of our luggage trains got stuck in the mud, and we had to spend considerable effort and time getting the animals and supplies unstuck and carrying them to drier ground."
 VIETmisc.7016.a:0 "I hate traveling…."
 VIETmisc.7017.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Coincidental Dream?"
 VIETmisc.7017.desc:0 ""I swear I've seen this place in my dream before!" [dreamer.GetTitledFirstName] exclaims. "It looks so familiar! Yes, yes, in my dream, the geography and landscape looked exactly like this."\n\nWe have been traveling in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName] for a few hours today when [dreamer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] got excited all of a sudden because of this.\n\n"How wondrous!" [dreamer.GetSheHe] continues. "This must've been a sign from [dreamer.GetFaith.HighGodName]." "
 VIETmisc.7017.a:0 "Let’s hope it’s a good omen."
 VIETmisc.7017.b:0 "Tell me more about your dream."
 VIETmisc.7018.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Local Wedding"
 VIETmisc.7018.desc:0 "What a coincidence! We happened to stop by a certain village in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName] right when the locals were holding a wedding between two of the great clans living there.\n\nThe bride is beautiful and graceful in her traditional [culture.GetName] wedding clothes, while the groom is just as handsome and charming. More importantly, this is just the start of a huge and lively feast of epic proportions, and the locals have invited us to join in. There is plenty of food and drink to go around for everyone, even strangers, they say, and the festivities will likely last several days."
 VIETmisc.7018.a:0 "Sounds like a fun occasion! Why not?"
 VIETmisc.7018.b:0 "We have places to be. We cannot tarry."
 VIETmisc.7019.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Traveling Bard"
 VIETmisc.7019.desc:0 "We were resting along the road in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName] when a traveling [culture.GetName] bard happened to pass by. [bard.GetSheHe|U] introduced [bard.GetHerselfHimself] as [bard.GetFullName].\n\nOne of my guards offered the [bard.GetWomanMan] a few coins in exchange for some entertainment. [bard.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] then sang through several songs in the local [culture.GetLanguage.GetName] dialect, and there was little doubt about [bard.GetHerHis] talent. The melancholy songs touched our hearts deeply, and the joyful songs roused our spirits."
 VIETmisc.7019.a:0 "Thank you for the performance!"
 VIETmisc.7019.b:0 "Have some coins for a few more songs!"
 VIETmisc.7019.c:0 "I’ll try to note down the songs I like."

 VIETmisc.7020.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Bad Water"
 VIETmisc.7020.desc:0 "While resting during our travels, we were resting when [drinker.GetFirstName] went to search for some water. It seems [drinker.GetSheHe] is really thirsty, and didn’t have enough water saved up in [drinker.GetHerHis] waterskin!\n\nUnfortunately, we realized too late that the water [drinker.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] drew from looked like standing water. Many are aware that standing water, such as those found in marshes and wetlands, are often dangerous for drinking. Perhaps [drinker.GetSheHe] was too eager or thirsty, and wasn't thinking straight.\n\nAnyways, [drinker.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is already feeling a little sick."
 VIETmisc.7020.a:0 "[drinker.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], you fool!"
 VIETmisc.7020.b:0 "I know some herbs that can help."
 VIETmisc.7020.c:0 "$VIETmisc.7020.b$"
 VIETmisc.7020.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! There is a stereotype that medieval people only drank alcohol or other drinks besides water, as water back then was of such poor quality. However, medieval people knew how to distinguish between water that could be safely drunk, and water that was not suitable for consumption. As such, they would for example avoid water near urban areas or marshlands, while seeking cleaner water elsewhere. "
 VIETmisc.7021.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Water, At Last!"
 VIETmisc.7021.desc:0 "We had been traveling for much of the day, weary and tired, as there hadn’t been a good place to properly rest for several hours. Wasn’t this supposed to be a well-traveled road?\n\nYet lo and behold, we eventually saw a small stream of water, and what more, there were old, worn-out bronze cups hung by chains to a nearby boulder. It seems that the locals, or perhaps whoever was in charge of this region, generously provided these cups to travelers to more easily collect water."
 VIETmisc.7021.a:0 "Thank [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] for this refreshing water!"

 VIETmisc.7022.desc:0 "While traveling in the desert of [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName], we met a lovely lass of [culture.GetName] extraction who introduces herself as [trickster.GetFirstName].\n\nAs we approach her, she begins singing and dancing what seems to be a local song, gazing at us seductively as she beckons for us to join her. However, as soon as I reach over to touch her, we all realize there’s nothing but a pile of sand in front of us.\n\nWe only saw a mirage.\n\nProbably."
 VIETmisc.7022.a:0 "Our next stop isn’t too far away, thank [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]."

 VIETmisc.7023.desc:0 "In one of the harsher parts of the desert in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName], we come across the remains of some travelers who must have passed away not too long ago. May [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] bless these unfortunate souls in the afterlife.\n\nAlas, their fate is not uncommon. Few would doubt the fact that these kinds of deserts are unforgiving. After all, even those experienced with such terrain and conditions could meet their untimely end in such barren terrain if they are unlucky.\n\nWe are fortunate that we still have many supplies left."
 VIETmisc.7023.a:0 "Continue onwards to our destination."
 VIETmisc.7023.b:0 "Take time to give the deceased a proper funeral."
 VIETmisc.7024.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ A Mirage?"
 VIETmisc.7024.desc:0 "We've been wandering the desert of [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName] for hours without rest. We saw a mirage of an oasis up ahead, and bitterly laughed at ourselves for being so helpless, even though things haven't even gotten that bad yet. The mirage was so convincing, we even heard the noise of water and animals!\n\n“Aahhh!” [person.GetFirstName] yells, as [person.GetSheHe] trips over a plant and splashes into water.\n\nHuh. Looks like the mirage was actually real after all – praise [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]!"
 VIETmisc.7024.a:0 "We laugh heartily as we pull [person.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] out of the oasis waters."

 VIETmisc.7025.desc:0 "After we camped somewhere in the wilderness of [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName] for the night, we were blessed with a most spectacular vision: an aurora.\n\nHigh above us, the night sky which had been of the purest darkness is transformed into one of vibrant colors. Like curtains or rays of sunshine in all sorts of colors, they erupt across the horizon, dazzling us with a magnificent display."
 VIETmisc.7025.a:0 "Simply amazing."
 VIETmisc.7025.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! The term #italic aurora#! as we understand it only dates back to the last few centuries (derived from the Roman goddess of the dawn). However, we have plenty of historical sources describing auroras, such as Roman and Chinese written accounts, and auroras feature prominently in the mythologies of certain peoples around the world. For example, Seneca, the 1st century Roman philosopher, statesman, and writer, described an aurora in his #italic Naturales Quaestiones#! that was sighted during the reign of Emperor Tiberius which appeared over Ostia, near Rome."

The structure, [scholar.GetSheHe] says, has been badly worn down by the elements.\n\nAs we briefly rest by these ruins, [scholar.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] remarks, with a sigh, “Life is so ephemeral, isn’t it? To think that these must have been some sort of glorious building ages ago. Some day, we too will be in even worse shape than these ruins.”"
 VIETmisc.7026.a:0 "Our lives are ephemeral, but [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] is not."

He made all sorts of ridiculous statements like all the enemies he’d killed or the women he slept with.\n\nAfter he started harassing other guests, the tavern staff kicked him out – he wasn’t so strong after all!
