 # Artifact Events (Both Old and New Combined)
 
 VIETmisc.5000.t:0 "The Abacus"
 VIETmisc.5000.desc:0 "A merchant I am acquainted with has recently decided to retire. He is growing old now and is becoming less involved in the world of commerce, and has made enough money over the years to retire comfortably.\n\nAnyways, I was visiting him today, and he offered to sell me his trusted abacus. He thinks it will better serve me in my work."
 VIETmisc.5000.a:0 "I will gladly take it - you have a deal!"
 VIETmisc.5000.b:0 "I could do the work myself without this contraption."
 VIETmisc.5001.t:0 "The Caliper"
 VIETmisc.5001.desc:0 "I was bored one day and watching some of my servants cleaning my residence. They were sorting through some old belongings, deciding what would and wouldn't be tossed in the trash, when I noticed a beautiful looking caliper in the pile of things. Few calipers are as finely crafted and exquisite in quality as this one I saw, so I asked one of the maids there - a rather sharp lass - if she knew anything about it.\n\n"Maybe long ago you could find calipers in every household across the land, but not anymore," the maid said, "Especially one of this quality."\n\nI nodded sagely, as I examined it. My maid added that as a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], I can obviously keep it if I like it. No one would stop me, after all."
 VIETmisc.5001.a:0 "Why not. It's beautiful, even if I don't have much use for it."
 VIETmisc.5001.b:0 "What am I, a crazy mad[ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan]? I'm no caliper collector."
 VIETmisc.5002.t:0 "To See More Clearly"
 VIETmisc.5002.desc:0 "There is a traveling scholar visiting my court today. He owns many impressive instruments, many which he says would take him too long to explain the purpose of, but a seemingly simple magnifying glass piques my interest. It has been crafted with care - on its handle are carved a few geometric patterns, and overall it looks quite nice.\n\nThe scholar says he is willing to sell the magnifying glass to me for a good price before he departs, if I am interested. An instrument of that quality would help me read and see things up close...."
 VIETmisc.5002.a:0 "Sounds like a deal! I'll take it then."
 VIETmisc.5002.b:0 "No thanks, I just found it interesting."
 VIETmisc.5002.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Since ancient times, humans have used selected shards of crystal, obsidian, or glass to get a clearer view of close-up objects as a primitive version of the modern magnifying glass. "Modern" magnifying glass lenses as we know them probably developed sometime during the high medieval period, based on advancements by Islamic and Christian scholars. These would later evolve to become the first proper eyeglasses."
 VIETmisc.5003.t:0 "An Hourglass"
 VIETmisc.5003.desc:0 "I was in town today, and I came across the stall of a traveling merchant, who had various interesting devices and items on sale. He shows me a so-called hourglass. This is not a tool one does not see too often, but the man assures me it can measure time much more accurately than other methods that people typically use. If I am willing to pay but a small amount of gold, it can be mine, and I will be able to keep track of time like few others can."
 VIETmisc.5003.a:0 "And I shall have this fascinating device!"
 VIETmisc.5003.b:0 "I have no need for such a silly little thing."
 VIETmisc.5003.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! The first known hourglass may have been made as early as the 8th century CE by a Frankish monk named Liutprand, though there is little evidence to this story. Depictions of hourglasses are scant until the 14th century, when they suddenly become much more commonly depicted in art, so it is otherwise difficult to ascertain the device's origins and when it was invented. However, they became extremely common by the end of the 14th century due to their simple effectiveness."
 VIETmisc.5004.t:0 "Cracking Nuts"
 VIETmisc.5004.desc:0 "[nutgifter.GetTitledFirstName] has presented me with a gift - a wonderfully crafted nutcracker, painted with vibrant colors and made to resemble my own image. It'll be useful for eating nuts, of course, but they also say it scares away evil spirits as it bares its nut-cracking teeth at them."
 VIETmisc.5004.a:0 "Well then! Let's go find some nuts to crack."
 VIETmisc.5004.b:0 "Bah, humbug! I don't need it. Toss it somewhere."
 VIETmisc.5005.t:0 "An Astronomer's Hard Work"
 VIETmisc.5005.desc:0 "It has recently come to my attention that a local astronomer has been diligently working on some star charts to map the heavens. These aren't just pieces of parchment with lines and drawings over them, of course; they're also quite lovely to look at, with beautiful artwork depicting the various constellations and celestial bodies. Overall, it's a process that takes a lot of time and a lot of work. Anyhow, he has graciously offered to sell me one of his charts for a small fee."
 VIETmisc.5005.a:0 "How kind! I will graciously accept, then."
 VIETmisc.5005.b:0 "He can keep it. Why would I need one?"
 VIETmisc.5006.t:0 "Silverset Or Not?"
 VIETmisc.5006.desc:0 "I was in town when I came by a silversmith's shop. He was excited to see me, as he said he had just finished making a fine set of silverware - one fit only for someone like a great [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], such as myself. He is willing to sell it for a good price. Judging by how luxurious the set looks, this seems like a great deal!\n\nHowever, then again, do I really need more symbols of my wealth and influence? It is a small set, after all, and would only be of use to me personally or for very small events."
 VIETmisc.5006.a:0 "Why not? I'm not vain - I just like nice things!"
 VIETmisc.5006.b:0 "I should restrain myself. I already have enough tableware."
 VIETmisc.5007.t:0 "An Exotic Quill"
 VIETmisc.5007.desc:0 "While browsing a merchant's shop, I notice a rather attractive quill pen. I am told it was made using the feather of an exotic, rare, mythical bird that lives in the legendary island of so-and-so that is located many, many leagues away from here. It is said this bird is extremely hard to catch, so if I want to buy this quill, I will have to pay a hefty price. But by [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], it is one wonderful looking quill, and would surely make me look both intellectual and stylish if I were to possess it and use it everyday for writing."
 VIETmisc.5007.a:0 "I can afford such a fine quill!"
 VIETmisc.5007.b:0 "On second thought, I don't need it."
 VIETmisc.5008.t:0 "The Lovely Pitcher"
 VIETmisc.5008.desc:0 "Some local, lesser nobles stopped by to pay me a visit today. To commemorate the occasion, I was presented with a gift of a lovely pitcher made from fine metal.\n\nAfter they leave, I take some time to examine the pitcher. It is definitely a higher quality one, with unique engravings and decorations on it, done in the typical [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] artistic style."
 VIETmisc.5008.a:0 "Keep it around for important occasions."
 VIETmisc.5008.b:0 "Sell it to someone, it's not that special."
 VIETmisc.5009.t:0 "The Common Pitcher"
 VIETmisc.5009.desc:0 "Today I paid a visit to a local town, to ascertain how it was doing and discuss local affairs with the town's notables. Before I left, a couple of the local artisans presented me with a gift of a wooden pitcher to commemorate the occasion. It is of fine quality, of good craftsmanship, and decorated in the usual [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] manner, though it is still a rather simple thing and I am not sure whether a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] like myself should keep such a simple thing."
 VIETmisc.5009.a:0 "Thank them and keep it - it is still a good gift!"
 VIETmisc.5009.b:0 "Sell this worthless thing to some other commoner."
 VIETmisc.5010.t:0 "Extremely Secure"
 VIETmisc.5010.desc:0 "I have heard of a locksmith nearby who can make locks that are so hard to open, no one will ever be able to successfully lockpick it, and many people have vouched for the quality of this man's locks, including a couple of my courtiers.\n\nIn fact, the locksmith has heard of my interest in his art, and he has offered to produce a special chest for me. It will intentionally look plain and of acceptable but otherwise unremarkable design, so it won't be for show or look too flashy, but that is precisely the point; otherwise, whether it's valuables, incriminating letters, or precious mementos, it will keep anything safe - as long as I have the key, of course."
 VIETmisc.5010.a:0 "I will order one to my specifications."
 VIETmisc.5010.b:0 "I have nothing to hide, so I don't need it."
 VIETmisc.5011.t:0 "A Good Mirror"
 VIETmisc.5011.desc:0 "There is a glassmith living nearby who can make glass that is very clear, an extremely difficult feat to achieve. I've considered buying a hand mirror made by this fellow, and today I even visited his shop to see some of his artwork up close. All in all, I'm impressed. There is no doubt about his skill.\n\nWhile there, he shows me one mirror in particular. After seeing it but once, I swear there must be #italic something#! magical or ethereal about it, but I suppose that goes without saying for most expertly made mirrors.\n\nI am very tempted to buy this mirror."
 VIETmisc.5011.a:0 "I can afford to buy this - make me one good hand mirror."
 VIETmisc.5011.b:0 "My current mirrors are poorer quality but I'm fine with them."
 VIETmisc.5012.t:0 "Checkmate!"
 VIETmisc.5012.desc:0 "Chess is becoming increasingly popular. Even if I don't play it much, it might be worth it to invest in acquiring a quality chess set for me in case I ever need it, if only to present myself as a modern, sociable leader.\n\nToday an opportunity presents itself: it has been brought to my attention that a famed traveling merchant passing through the area is in possession of an old but lovely ivory chess set, and he is willing to sell it. Perhaps it is time I get myself my own personal chess set? I should try to catch him before he leaves town if I want to buy it."
 VIETmisc.5012.a:0 "Let's go get ourselves that chess set."
 VIETmisc.5012.b:0 "This is a waste of my money."
 VIETmisc.5013.t:0 "Checkmate?"
 VIETmisc.5013.desc:0 "Chess is becoming increasingly popular. Even if I don't play it much, it wouldn't hurt to have a cheap chess set around to practice my chess moves. Some may decry chess as a waste of time, because who would bother staring at a bunch of poor, abstract representations of armies moving back and forth? Still, if I am good enough, I could impress some people, or at least be able to socialize with the many others who play the game and talk about strategies and tactics.\n\nThere are some artisans nearby who can produce one such cheap chess set made from local wood, if I want."
 VIETmisc.5013.a:0 "I'll buy one such chess set - this should be fun!"
 VIETmisc.5013.b:0 "You know, strategy games #italic are#! a pointless a waste of time."
 VIETmisc.5014.t:0 "A Fine Eating Tool"
 VIETmisc.5014.desc:0 "A local scholar recently returned from his travels to the east, and I invited him over to share stories of all he saw and recorded. Thus, I am hosting a small feast tonight in his honor.\n\nAs we all listen to his stories, he mentions in particular that he was presented with a gift of a few porcelain chopsticks he received from a friend he made while residing in one of the eastern realms. He says he can give me one of these pairs of chopsticks as a gift. There is no doubt that these are no ordinary chopsticks, judging by their beauty."
 VIETmisc.5014.a:0 "Thanks! My old chopsticks are drab and wretched by comparison."
 VIETmisc.5014.b:0 "Thanks! I don't know how to use them, but they seem nice."
 VIETmisc.5014.c:0 "No thanks, you don't need to give me one."
 VIETmisc.5015.t:0 "Bone Dice"
 VIETmisc.5015.desc:0 "Playing dice is often associated with the lower classes, gamblers, criminals, and those of little consequence, but even the upper echelons of society enjoy playing some good dice games. An acquaintance of mine who enjoys these amusements has a spare pair of dice of lovely appearance, carved from fine animal bone, that I can keep for myself if I am interested. After all, it's better to play with one's own dice that one can trust, rather than rely on strangers' dice which could potentially be loaded."
 VIETmisc.5015.a:0 "Sure, I'll keep it for myself if that's not an issue."
 VIETmisc.5015.b:0 "I shouldn't waste my life playing games like this...."
 VIETmisc.5016.t:0 "Wooden Dice"
 VIETmisc.5016.desc:0 "Playing dice is often associated with the lower classes, gamblers, criminals, and those of little consequence, but even the upper echelons of society enjoy playing some good dice games. An acquaintance of mine who enjoys these amusements has a spare pair of simple wooden dice that I can keep for myself if I am interested. While not the crudest things out there, this pair of dice isn't remarkable by any means.\n\nStill, it's better to play with one's own dice that one can trust, rather than rely on strangers' dice which could potentially be loaded."
 VIETmisc.5016.a:0 "I don't mind, I'll take those dice."
 VIETmisc.5016.b:0 "I shouldn't waste my life playing games like this...."
 VIETmisc.5017.t:0 "Silk Slippers"
 VIETmisc.5017.desc:0 "My feet feel so sore, tired, and outright miserable lately. I've thought about buying some silk slippers to walk around in when in my private quarters. Plus, I would look quite stylish. I know of someone nearby who makes good slippers, and her skill is said to be quite remarkable. Perhaps I should pay a visit to her shop."
 VIETmisc.5017.a:0 "Yes! That's a good idea."
 VIETmisc.5017.b:0 "No, no. That's too extravagant."
 VIETmisc.5018.t:0 "An Ordinary Spoon"
 VIETmisc.5018.desc:0 "There is a pewter spoon I am very fond of that I like to use regularly when eating meals in private. Even though it is not the most dignified looking thing, maybe I should use it more regularly just in case - at least I'll know I can trust this spoon won't be smeared with some dangerous substances!"
 VIETmisc.5018.a:0 "A good idea."
 VIETmisc.5018.b:0 "There are better spoons out there."
 VIETmisc.5019.t:0 "For Good Measure"
 VIETmisc.5019.desc:0 "While exploring my residence one day, I found a solid measuring rod lying around. I think it belonged to one of my servants - perhaps they have little use for it now? Anyhow, the rod is made of hardy but lightweight stone, and I imagine it might help me with a variety of tasks and matters in the future."
 VIETmisc.5019.a:0 "Even for someone of my status, it might come in handy."
 VIETmisc.5019.b:0 "What am I thinking? I'm not some lowly commoner."
 VIETmisc.5020.t:0 "The Antediluvian Flute"
 VIETmisc.5020.desc:0 "Recently, a hunter in my realm went out hunting one day when he stumbled on a hole. He was curious and dug deeper; eventually, he found some ancient artifacts. Most were useless and broken, save for a flute made from what appears to be the bone of a giant creature or man.\n\nWhen I passed by his village today on my way to attend some meeting in another village, I was shown this fascinating find. This hunter, who played the flute in his spare time, showed me how this ancient flute could still play music - it sounded pleasant, if melancholy and strange.\n\nThe villagers offered to give this flute to me as a present. Surely I would be interested in such a strange and interesting relic of the past? It is no ordinary simple flute, after all."
 VIETmisc.5020.a:0 "Thank you for your kind gift."
 VIETmisc.5020.b:0 "It unnerves me. No thanks."
 VIETmisc.5021.t:0 "Keeping Balance"
 VIETmisc.5021.desc:0 "One day, some merchants I am acquainted with wished to offer me a present after we finished negotiating a deal for some business related to my realm's administration. Their gift turned out to be a weighing scale, made with fine materials.\n\n"You should always keep your own scales, as you never know what to expect from the scales of a dishonest trader, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]," one of the merchants tells me. "We can vouch that these pair of scales are well balanced. Even if you don't have much use for it, I'm sure one of your servants might. At the very least, you can intimidate dishonest merchants into giving you an honest deal.""
 VIETmisc.5021.a:0 "This will surely be useful! I appreciate it."
 VIETmisc.5021.b:0 "I don't need it, but thank you nonetheless."
 VIETmisc.5022.t:0 "Hammer Away"
 VIETmisc.5022.desc:0 "I am out and about today, inspecting some of my servants at work. They have been completing some minor repairs to the wall and structure in one part of my residence. As I walk slowly, observing the whole scene, I come across a hammer; I pick it up, and like how firm it feels in my hand.\n\nThere's something special about this hammer. Though I am not a common craftsman or laborer, I can't help but admire this hammer, the more I think about it. After all, aren't buildings, ships, and other great constructs made with such a simple thing?\n\nPerhaps even the great [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] might find utility in this everyday tool! At the least, I can keep it around to inspire myself to work harder."
 VIETmisc.5022.a:0 "I'll keep it by my side."
 VIETmisc.5022.b:0 "It is interesting, but nothing more."
 VIETmisc.5023.t:0 "Shovel In, Shovel Out"
 VIETmisc.5023.desc:0 "I recently needed to repair part of my residence, so I ordered a few of my servants to take care of it. A number of laborers from a couple nearby villages were also brought in to assist with this effort.\n\nWhile I was inspecting their work, I noticed one man had a particularly fascinating shovel with him - or at least I thought it was fascinating. Despite its seeming crudeness, it clearly displayed a sturdiness and power I felt was uncommon in such a simple tool, not to mention there was a simple, rustic charm in its appearance. The laborer, seeing my admiration for it, said I could keep it if I wanted.\n\n"I don't know how a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] could make use of a shovel," he says, "but I got another one back home, and I am sure a great [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord] such as yourself will think of a good purpose for it.""
 VIETmisc.5023.a:0 "That sounds splendid. Thank you!"
 VIETmisc.5023.b:0 "No thanks, I just wanted a look."
 VIETmisc.5024.t:0 "Knapsack"
 VIETmisc.5024.desc:0 "An adventurer passed by recently, and visited my court to regale us with tales of lands beyond. This adventurer, before leaving, gifted me a leather knapsack, saying it might be of use to me, to help me carry things while on trips. It's not the most beautiful thing ever, but the craftsman who made it clearly designed it to have a rustic, simplistic charm, while being able to handle the burden of carrying many things with ease."
 VIETmisc.5024.a:0 "It could help me a lot!"
 VIETmisc.5024.b:0 "It's rubbish, give it a servant or dispose of it."
 VIETmisc.5025.t:0 "A Last Minute Gift"
 VIETmisc.5025.desc:0 "It was my first time at that tavern. I only came there to visit a member of the local elite, but the tavern's staff and regulars greeted me warmly, as they had not expected such their [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] to stop by. Admittedly, I came on short notice given the meeting location was changed at the last minute, but the staff did a good job of hosting me despite this.\n\nThe staff had little time to prepare a proper gift, so they presented me with a simple carved wooden bowl to keep as a souvenir. It isn't just any bowl, however, as it is beautifully carved with a few [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] stylistic flourishes on it. It isn't the usual thing a great [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] would have, but it is mine to keep, if I so wish, and it would be nice to have when I'm eating in private or on the go."
 VIETmisc.5025.a:0 "Of course, I appreciate it."
 VIETmisc.5025.b:0 "No thanks! This is worthless!"
 VIETmisc.5026.t:0 "Unlocking My Potential"
 VIETmisc.5026.desc:0 "I paid a visit to one of my former guard captains, who retired recently. As we took a walk outside and made small talk, this guard wanted to offer me a present. It turned out to be an oddly shaped metal stick, so I was offended at first - what sort of joke was this?\n\n"This is a very good lockpick, better than most I've used," I was told, as my guard explained to me the value of this seemingly worthless gift. "Once you get the hang of it, you can open almost any lock. It served me well for many years in my duties to protect you. I don't need it, but I think even a great [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] like yourself might find it beneficial to have around. If you have time, I can teach you some techniques to make the best use of it later today.""
 VIETmisc.5026.a:0 "Ah! An intriguing gift... but one of great utility."
 VIETmisc.5026.b:0 "Now, now, I leave dirty work to my spies and assassins!"
 VIETmisc.5027.t:0 "The Ceramic Tankard"
 VIETmisc.5027.desc:0 "I am at a local banquet hosted by a lesser noble. The host presents me with a ceramic tankard as a gift for the occasion. It is a lovely thing, decorated with some [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] artwork on it. Clearly it was created by an expert craftsman, so though I may not necessarily use it in more formal occasions like a great feast, I could keep it for everyday use."
 VIETmisc.5027.a:0 "Thank you very much for the thoughtful gift."
 VIETmisc.5027.b:0 "It's too plain for my tastes. Perhaps I can resell it...."
 VIETmisc.5028.t:0 "The Wooden Tankard"
 VIETmisc.5028.desc:0 "I am at a local banquet hosted by a lesser noble. The host presents me with a wooden tankard as a gift. It is plain with only a few simple designs on it, though of good quality, and it is clearly created by an expert craftsman. Though I may not necessarily use it in more formal occasions like a great feast, I could keep it for everyday use."
 VIETmisc.5028.a:0 "It is a modest but good gift."
 VIETmisc.5028.b:0 "I'll sell it later - it's not my style."
 VIETmisc.5029.t:0 "A Solution to Itchiness"
 VIETmisc.5029.desc:0 "Yesterday, I had an atrociously annoying itch on my skin near my shoulder blade. I found it hard to scratch, because no matter how I angled myself, I just couldn’t get my fingers to reach the itch.\n\nIt then occurred to me - why have I never thought about keeping a backscratcher around? That is, I’ve used them before, but maybe I should keep one just for my personal use to take care of annoying itches like the one I was having.\n\nToday, while in town, I came across an artisan who was good at carving wood. Having this artisan make a backscratcher would more than suffice if I so wish."
 VIETmisc.5029.a:0 "I need a reliable way to scratch myself - can I buy one?" 
 VIETmisc.5029.b:0 "Do I really need it? I can sort of reach it by myself… sort of." 
 VIETmisc.5030.t:0 "A Stick for Walking"
 VIETmisc.5030.desc:0 "Occasionally, I’ve been taking walks near my house to get some fresh air, and I like to venture more into the wilderness to see the beauty of the untamed land. However, the terrain isn’t always easy to traverse.\n\nToday, while going on such a walk, I came across a large wooden stick. I picked it up out of curiosity, and found it sturdy and easy to grip. I wanted to see if it could help me keep my balance. I firmly planted it on the ground, and took a few steps as I tried using it as a walking stick. It seemed to work well enough for this purpose!\n\nHowever, as it is a stick found out in the wild, it isn't the most pleasant looking, and it does need to be tidied up a bit. I could take this to a local artisan who could refine it a bit with a little carving."
 VIETmisc.5030.a:0 "Very well. Let’s find an artisan who can help me with that."
 VIETmisc.5030.b:0 "Then again, it looks weird, and it's just one of many sticks."
 VIETmisc.5031.t:0 "The Pair of Gloves"
 VIETmisc.5031.desc:0 "I am traveling around my realm. when I pass by a leathersmith’s workshop in one town. I peruse the products the leathersmith has on sale, and notice a pair of simple leather gloves. The leathersmith says it was initially made for a client who later canceled the order after the gloves had already been made, unfortunately.\n\nI put the gloves on, and to my surprise, it fits my hand perfectly. It feels nice, too. Since it won’t be going to whoever originally commissioned it, perhaps I could buy it so the leathersmith’s hard work won’t be in vain."
 VIETmisc.5031.a:0 "If you’d like, I’ll buy the gloves."
 VIETmisc.5031.b:0 "They’re nice but not my style."
 VIETmisc.5032.t:0 "Visiting a [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship|U]"
 VIETmisc.5032.desc:0 "I paid a visit to a local [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship] today. After the initial formalities, the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] gave me a quick tour of the place.\n\nWhile there, I ended up having a good conversation with one of the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')], who showed me some of the tables and desks where they did their work copying [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] scriptures. I was also shown some of the candlesticks they used to keep the room bright when it was after sunset. These candlesticks were very elegant, made of ceramic material, decorated with various lovely symbols.\n\nThe [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] told me I could keep one if I wanted."
 VIETmisc.5032.a:0 "Why, I would be honored. Thank you."
 VIETmisc.5032.b:0 "You'll need them more than me."
 VIETmisc.5033.t:0 "Night Patrol"
 VIETmisc.5033.desc:0 "While going on their patrols at night, many of my guards use torches to light the way, though some keep some lanterns with them as well. One night, as I was going to and from one part of my residence to another, I paid close attention to the lantern that the guard escorting me was holding.\n\n“Do you like it, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]?” my guard asks, as we continue walking. “I have a spare one in my barracks. You can keep this one if you like, if you feel your current candles or lanterns are not to your liking.”\n\nIt seems the guard mistook me for having an acute interest in the lantern. To be fair, though, it wouldn’t hurt to have another one around."
 VIETmisc.5033.a:0 "I'll be glad to have it!"
 VIETmisc.5033.b:0 "No, no, I don’t need one."
 VIETmisc.5034.t:0 "A Wonderful Handkerchief"
 VIETmisc.5034.desc:0 "A handkerchief came into my possession not too long ago, and I found the fabric used to make it just wonderful. It absorbs things pretty well, such as if I’m sweating or sneezing, but it never seems to leave too foul an odor after I wash it. I should keep it around me more often."
 VIETmisc.5034.a:0 "It will be by my side from now on."
 VIETmisc.5034.b:0 "But there are others I can use, too."
 VIETmisc.5035.t:0 "Like A Candy Store"
 VIETmisc.5035.desc:0 "Recently, I’ve gotten into the habit of eating a bit of candy here and there as a snack. However, it would be nice if I had a more convenient way of storing it so I wouldn’t need to have my servants search my residence for some of it.\n\nOne of my maids suggested that I use one of the jars we had at home to hold the candy. That way, I can keep it in a safe and dry place, and if I wanted, I could carry it with me into different rooms, or even on short trips. She then presented me with a small, ceramic jar she found in my kitchen that she felt would suffice for this purpose."
 VIETmisc.5035.a:0 "Brilliant idea! Now, what should I put in the jar?"
 VIETmisc.5035.b:0 "That’s nice, but it’s your job to bring me candy."
 VIETmisc.5036.t:0 "Stay Awake!"
 VIETmisc.5036.desc:0 "Today I needed to inspect my soldiers. It was, frankly, a dull affair and I’m sure they were as bored of it as I was. While sitting there, “watching” my soldiers, I dozed off.\n\n#bold PHHHWWWEEEEEE#!\n\nI jolt awake and jump out of my chair upon hearing the sound of a whistle. It seems some of the soldiers were startled too. Anyways, it appeared the commander blew a whistle to issue various commands to the troops.\n\nAfter the inspection, I talk with the commander and our conversation drifted to the whistle. “Ah, these are good whistles, made of wood,” I am told. “High quality.
