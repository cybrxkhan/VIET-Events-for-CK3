 # VIETmisc.1000-1999 For classic VIET style event chains (generally linear, as opposed to vanilla's Story Cycles)
 VIETmisc.1000.t:0 "xxxxx"	# Event to push it to the winter months???
 VIETmisc.1000.desc:0 "xxxxx"
 VIETmisc.1000.a:0 "xxxxx"
 VIETmisc.1001.t:0 "Winter Wind Sentiment"
 VIETmisc.1001.desc:0 "As the winter wind begins to come down this year, the chill in the air reminds me of someone dear to my heart, someone I had not thought about for years."
 VIETmisc.1001.a:0 "Her."
 VIETmisc.1002.t:0 "My Memories are Still Beautiful"
 VIETmisc.1002.desc:0 "Do I want to remember?\n\nAs much as it pains me, thinking about her still makes me so happy all the while."
 VIETmisc.1002.a:0 "Back then...."
 VIETmisc.1003.t:0 "Despite a Sheet of Frozen Tears"
 VIETmisc.1003.desc:0 "She was a girl who lived nearby. I think she was of high birth - otherwise how would I have been able to play with her in the first place? - but her family was impoverished and had little influence on local affairs.\n\nWe played a lot as children, her and me, the both of us. A happy little boy and girl, two innocents without a care in the world.\n\nNow, I’m starting to really miss those times."
 VIETmisc.1003.a:0 "Makes me feel melancholy."
 VIETmisc.1004.t:0 "And I Don’t Remember"
 VIETmisc.1004.desc:0 "Unfortunately a lot of my memories of that girl are hazy.\n\nIt's been many years, after all.\n\nVague visions briefly flash through my mind, as I struggle to remember what happened all those years ago."
 VIETmisc.1004.a:0 "It’s been a while, after all."
 VIETmisc.1005.t:0 "Why I Shed These Tears"
 VIETmisc.1005.desc:0 "For instance, I vaguely recall some argument we had. It was years later when we were a little older - not quite adults, but not little children either, though we were still young, and like all young people we did stupid things after all.\n\nI think I said some really nasty things to her.\n\nWait, that’s what happened, right? I don’t exactly recall.\n\nMaybe it was something else? Perhaps I offended her somehow and didn’t properly apologize?"
 VIETmisc.1005.a:0 "Whatever it was, I regretted doing it."
 VIETmisc.1006.t:0 "Now the Winter Winds of Yesteryear"
 VIETmisc.1006.desc:0 "When did we have that argument again? Oh, it must have been sometime during the winter, I think. Argh! Just thinking about it puts me in a bad mood. Sure, sure, I tell myself, I was young, I was young, but come on, no one should say those kinds of things."
 VIETmisc.1006.a:0 "I would apologize now if I could."
 VIETmisc.1007.t:0 "Turn Back the Clock for Us"
 VIETmisc.1007.desc:0 "Why did we even fight that time? We made up so quickly, as young people are wont to do, but I am rather curious now. What was it that got us into that argument in the first place?\n\nSuch a bothersome thing to remember.\n\nRegardless, how I wish I could go back, make sure it never happened! Admittedly, I’m probably thinking about this too much, anyways."
 VIETmisc.1007.a:0 "We did reconcile after all."
 VIETmisc.1008.t:0 "A Misunderstanding"
 VIETmisc.1008.desc:0 "Hmm. Now that I think it over, our conflict must have started with some sort of misunderstanding. It had to be.\n\nWe usually got along, that girl and I, and we shared things and agreed with each other many times. Surely there was some sort of misunderstanding - yes, that had to be it."
 VIETmisc.1008.a:0 "And somehow, thanks to that, we got into our argument...?"
 VIETmisc.1009.t:0 "A Moment’s Hesitation"
 VIETmisc.1009.desc:0 "Maybe she asked me a very sensitive question, and I did not respond immediately, making her think I had a negative response in mind?"
 VIETmisc.1009.a:0 "Maybe."
 VIETmisc.1010.t:0 "Cliched Sentimentalism"
 VIETmisc.1010.desc:0 "Or perhaps she wanted some romance - we were just starting to come to that age after all - but I misinterpreted her advances. It would be a bit of a cliche if that were the case, though."
 VIETmisc.1010.a:0 "Perhaps."
 VIETmisc.1011.t:0 "The Perfect Moment"
 VIETmisc.1011.desc:0 "What was it? I at least recall that she asked me something, yes, that was it, that’s what started this all. But I don’t quite remember what. Not yet, at least.\n\nShe did seem nervous, didn’t she? I now recall that.\n\nMaybe she had waited a long time to hear my answer to whatever she asked - to clear up some sort of misunderstanding, or to confirm something."
 VIETmisc.1011.a:0 "Hmm...."
 VIETmisc.1012.t:0 "Lost Forever"
 VIETmisc.1012.desc:0 "But anyways, I still miss that girl. We were such good friends.... And one has to wonder, could our relationship have deepened into something more beautiful?"
 VIETmisc.1012.a:0 "I'll never know."
 VIETmisc.1013.t:0 "Once More, Never Again"
 VIETmisc.1013.desc:0 "If we met again, I’d make sure we wouldn’t get into those sort of arguments, ever again. It’d just be like the good days, when we’d mess around and enjoy ourselves, when we did not have to worry about adult responsibilities. No more stupid arguments. No more."
 VIETmisc.1013.a:0 "I do miss her, don’t I?"
 VIETmisc.1014.t:0 "I Remain Young and Trusting"
 VIETmisc.1014.desc:0 "Though, now that I think about it, thinking that you will never get into stupid arguments is kind of naive. Only children think that everybody can simply get along with each other. The world just doesn’t work like that.\n\nYet, to be honest, I wanted - and want - that sort of relationship with that girl.\n\nA pure companionship.\n\nA pure love."
 VIETmisc.1014.a:0 "I suppose I’m still childish in a way, then."
 VIETmisc.1015.t:0 "With My Unspoken Love"
 VIETmisc.1015.desc:0 "Now I realize.\n\nI did love her after all.\n\nI wanted to be with her forever - silly, isn’t it? I thought she was the most wonderful person, the most perfect woman."
 VIETmisc.1015.a:0 "Yet I never told her."
 VIETmisc.1016.t:0 "And Numb Memories"
 VIETmisc.1016.desc:0 "Oh, wait now....\n\nNow I remember what she asked me.\n\nI can’t believe it. It’s so cliched. I should have remembered after all these years. She said it so randomly, so suddenly that day:"
 VIETmisc.1016.a:0 ""Hey, [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] do you love me?""
 VIETmisc.1017.t:0 "Once More, Never Again"
 VIETmisc.1017.desc:0 "I didn’t answer her at the time. But if she were here now, and asked me that question again, what would I tell her? Would I answer "yes"?"
 VIETmisc.1017.a:0 "Yes. Yes, a million times over, yes."
 VIETmisc.1018.t:0 "I Never Gave an Answer"
 VIETmisc.1018.desc:0 "And so I finally recall now why she was so angry.\n\nI didn’t give her any sort of proper response that day."
 VIETmisc.1018.a:0 "That must have hurt her deeply."
 VIETmisc.1019.t:0 "Which Pains Me"
 VIETmisc.1019.desc:0 "Maybe all these years, she wondered whether that boy ever truly loved her. Maybe all these years.\n\nFrankly, it hurts me too, that I never gave her a proper answer."
 VIETmisc.1019.a:0 "And I will never be able to."
 VIETmisc.1020.t:0 "But I Remain Beautiful"
 VIETmisc.1020.desc:0 "I wonder if she were here, now, what she would think. Would she even accept my resounding answer of "Yes!" to her question?\n\nI hope - and I only hope - that she would still think of me highly. I haven’t done many great things in life, but, then, nobody’s perfect. Back then, she always encouraged me to do my best."
 VIETmisc.1020.a:0 "I hope she is proud of me...."
 VIETmisc.1021.t:0 "And Leave Behind"
 VIETmisc.1021.desc:0 "But she is no longer here. Even though we made up after the incident, we soon became adults and, of course, we soon parted afterwards - parted forever.\n\nIt was inevitable, I suppose. We were young. We didn't realize that our childhood wouldn't last forever.\n\nNothing lasts forever. Nothing bad, nothing good."
 VIETmisc.1021.a:0 "Nothing."
 VIETmisc.1022.t:0 "The Warmth of Your Skin"
 VIETmisc.1022.desc:0 "But to this day, I still think of that silly girl. I still think of that stupid, silly way she smiled. I still think of those times we sat under that tree, side by side, our shoulders touching as we smiled and laughed and talked about nothing.\n\nMy friend.\n\nMy companion.\n\nMy inspiration.\n\nMy angel."
 VIETmisc.1022.a:0 "My first love."
 # Cinnamon Toast Crunch (the first VIET event chain ever)
 VIETmisc.1023.t:0 "Cinnamon!"
 VIETmisc.1023.desc:0 "It's no secret. I'm in love with cinnamon. When I was younger I didn't eat too much of it, but when I did, I enjoyed it greatly. Now that I am older, I can procure as much cinnamon as my treasury can handle. I like the swirls of spicy and sweet in every bite! There's nothing like cinnamon!"
 VIETmisc.1023.a:0 "Who can't see why I love the taste of cinnamon?"
 VIETmisc.1024.t:0 "A Taste of Cinnamon"
 VIETmisc.1024.desc:0 "I have a feast coming up. Many important people in my realm will be there. We will celebrate life and have a good time, and I intend to do that by serving everybody as many savory and sweet cinnamon dishes as possible, including my favorite - cinnamon toasted sticky buns. Everyone will see why I love the taste of cinnamon.\n\nUnfortunately cinnamon is an expensive delicacy. The cost for this otherwise mundane feast will be a bit high. But I crave those crazy spices! I just crave them!"
 VIETmisc.1024.a:0 "The feast will be cinnamon themed, no matter the cost."
 VIETmisc.1025.t:0 "Cinnamon, Cinnamon Everywhere"
 VIETmisc.1025.desc:0 "The food at the feast was delicious! Cinnamon oil to cook everything in. Cinnamon and garlic flavored fish. Cinnamon sprinkled in soups. Cinnamon in meat pies and sweet pies. Cinnamon spread on bread and fruit. And my favorite, cinnamon and honey-syrup slathered sticky buns! In fact I can't even remember what didn't have cinnamon at the feast.\n\nApparently some of my guests appreciated my tastes. Others didn't, however. I could see it in their eyes. The way their eyes shifted around when they looked at their food. The way they slowly ate it.\n\nHow sad, that there are people who cannot appreciate cinnamon!"
 VIETmisc.1025.a:0 "Some of my courtiers seemed concerned - they think I'm overdoing things! Ha!"
 VIETmisc.1026.t:0 "Crazy for Cinnamon"
 VIETmisc.1026.desc:0 "A few of my courtiers told me they were concerned about my eating habits. I eat cinnamon with everything, they claimed! But that of course is not true. I definitely eat other things.\n\nThey stubbornly insisted, however, that eating too much cinnamon wasn't good, despite whatever healing benefits it may have, and that I'd regret my irrational addiction.\n\nBut the thing is, I really do eat other things. Do people think I'm insane just because I had a cinnamon-themed feast? Can't they see why I love the taste of cinnamon?\n\nI'm feeling like some cinnamon toasted sticky buns for breakfast for tomorrow, anyhow. Or the next few days. Or weeks."
 VIETmisc.1026.a:0 "Who cares what they say? I'll have breakfast on a whole other level!"
 VIETmisc.1027.t:0 "Midas Fingers of Cinnamon"
 VIETmisc.1027.desc:0 "Maybe wanting the taste of cinnamon in the morning wasn't a good idea. After eating some cinnamon toasted sticky buns (my favorite cinnamon food!), my hands were so sticky, I got cinnamon and honey-syrup all over my fine robes, my face, my chair... everything I touch becomes a mess! However, I have an important meeting with my councillors right now, and I don't want to be late - what can I do? But I have no choice, as this is an important meeting."
 VIETmisc.1027.a:0 "Hopefully my councillors won't be too irritated with me."
 VIETmisc.1028.t:0 "They're Great! (Really!)"
 VIETmisc.1028.desc:0 "The meeting went alright, though my sticky cinnamon-covered fingers were a distraction. Thankfully I managed to prevent the stickiness from spreading everywhere. My councillors, instead of being irritated, found my situation hilarious. They made fun of not only me, but worse, of cinnamon itself! It appears now that everyone in my court is making fun of me.\n\nHow can someone as high as myself be the laughingstock of the entire realm, simply because I love the taste of cinnamon? My courtiers and vassals always plot and see everything I do. But can they see why I love the taste of cinnamon toast sticky buns?"
 VIETmisc.1028.a:0 "They have to understand. The swirls of spicy and sweet cinnamon in every bite!"
 VIETmisc.1029.t:0 "The Taste I Can See"
 VIETmisc.1029.desc:0 "I tried to explain to my courtiers. I really did! Cinnamon is so wonderful. Why would anyone not love it? Everything simply tastes better with it, whether it's eggs, waffles, sausages, beans, sweet buns, milk, or water... anything really. Even peasant gruel tastes like heavenly nectar if I add some cinnamon too it.\n\nBut no. No one understood. I asked them why cinnamon was so great. Why I had to like it. But no one came up with the right answers, and I must resign myself to the fact that no one will know why I love the taste of cinnamon. Why I love the taste of cinnamon toasted sticky buns, especially."
 VIETmisc.1029.a:0 "It's because there's a swirl of delicious cinnamon flavor in every bite."

 VIETmisc.1030.t:0 "Final Days"
 VIETmisc.1030.desc.male:0 "I have an elderly servant I am deeply attached to. For many years, she has served me loyally without complaint, and put up with all me - if there is anyone I cannot bear to be cruel to, it is this woman who has become like a beloved aunt or grandmother to me. But for the past few weeks, she has been on her deathbed, barely conscious, muttering strange things, and refusing food and drink."

 VIETmisc.1030.a:0 "We keep a vigil day and night, but we know it's only a matter of time."
 VIETmisc.1031.t:0 "Awake"
 VIETmisc.1031.desc.male:0 "One morning, I am chanting a few prayers quietly to myself for my servant's soul along with a few others in our household, when I get a little tired and decide to sit down next to her. I reach out and hold her hand - yet, as I do so, a miracle happens! She opens her eyes and looks around, as if trying to make sense of her surroundings. The moment she gazes at me, however, a look of utter happiness and deep love spreads across her face.\n\n"How are you feeling?" I say. "It's fine, don't worry. I'm here.""

 VIETmisc.1033.desc.male:0 "After the funeral of my beloved servant, I ask several of her relatives about what she told me before passing. It is clearly evident that she mistook me for someone else. At first, no one had any answers, until we managed to get hold of her younger sister, one of my other servants, who is very elderly herself.\n\nThis old lady, despite her age, has a look of strength and confidence about her as she calmly chuckles, "Ah, it's a funny coincidence, [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip].""

 VIETmisc.1034.t:0 "Coincidence"
 VIETmisc.1034.desc.male:0 ""[ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] was also the name of her first love," her sister explains. "They truly loved each other. But her beloved was in an accident the day before their wedding and he died in her arms, something she always felt guilt over.

She pauses for a few moments, trying to compose herself as she is clearly deeply moved by this all.

 VIETmisc.1036.desc:0 "For the last week or so, I have been feeling tired a lot. Therefore, I decided to sleep early today. Soon after, I find myself somewhere in the wilderness I do not recognize. It is a vast expanse of the greenest grass, dotted with fields of vibrant flowers of every color imaginable, flanked on both sides by breathtaking, snow-capped mountains. Above, the sun shines brightly.\n\n"Little [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!" a voice calls to me. "Little [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!""

Why did I dream of my [scope_VIET_grandparent_dream.Custom('VIETGrandparent')], like that?

 VIETmisc.1002.desc.female:0 "Do I want to remember?\n\nAs much as it pains me, thinking about him still makes me so happy all the while."
 VIETmisc.1003.desc.female:0 "He was a boy who lived nearby. I think he was of high birth - otherwise how would I have been able to play with him in the first place? - but his family was impoverished and had little influence on local affairs.\n\nWe played a lot as children, him and me, the both of us. A happy little boy and girl, two innocents without a care in the world.\n\nNow, I’m starting to really miss those times."
 VIETmisc.1003.desc.male.homosexual:0 "He was a boy who lived nearby. I think he was of high birth - otherwise how would I have been able to play with him in the first place? - but his family was impoverished and had little influence on local affairs.\n\nWe played a lot as children, him and me, the both of us. A happy little boy and boy, two innocents without a care in the world.\n\nNow, I’m starting to really miss those times."
 VIETmisc.1004.desc.female:0 "Unfortunately a lot of my memories of that boy are hazy.\n\nIt's been many years, after all.\n\nVague visions briefly flash through my mind, as I struggle to remember what happened all those years ago."
 VIETmisc.1005.desc.female:0 "For instance, I vaguely recall some argument we had. It was years later when we were a little older - not quite adults, but not little children either, though we were still young, and like all young people we did stupid things after all.\n\nI think I said some really nasty things to him.\n\nWait, that’s what happened, right? I don’t exactly recall.\n\nMaybe it was something else? Perhaps I offended him somehow and didn’t properly apologize?"
 VIETmisc.1006.desc.female:0 "When did we have that argument again? Oh, it must have been sometime during the winter, I think. Argh! Just thinking about it puts me in a bad mood. Sure, sure, I tell myself, I was young, I was young, but come on, no one should say those kinds of things."
 VIETmisc.1008.desc.female:0 "Hmm. Now that I think it over, our conflict must have started with some sort of misunderstanding. It had to be.\n\nWe usually got along, that boy and I, and we shared things and agreed with each other many times. Surely there was some sort of misunderstanding - yes, that had to be it."
 VIETmisc.1009.desc.female:0 "Maybe he asked me a very sensitive question, and I did not respond immediately, making him think I had a negative response in mind?"
 VIETmisc.1010.desc.female:0 "Or perhaps he wanted some romance - we were just starting to come to that age after all - but I misinterpreted his advances. It would be a bit of a cliche if that were the case, though."
 VIETmisc.1011.desc.female:0 "What was it? I at least recall that he asked me something, yes, that was it, that’s what started this all. But I don’t quite remember what. Not yet, at least.\n\nHe did seem nervous, didn’t he? I now recall that.\n\nMaybe he had waited a long time to hear my answer to whatever he asked - to clear up some sort of misunderstanding, or to confirm something."
 VIETmisc.1012.desc.female:0 "But anyways, I still miss that boy. We were such good friends.... And one has to wonder, could our relationship have deepened into something more beautiful?"
 VIETmisc.1013.desc.female:0 "If we met again, I’d make sure we wouldn’t get into those sort of arguments, ever again. It’d just be like the good days, when we’d mess around and enjoy ourselves, when we did not have to worry about adult responsibilities. No more stupid arguments. No more."
 VIETmisc.1013.a.female:0 "I do miss him, don’t I?"
 VIETmisc.1014.desc.female:0 "Though, now that I think about it, thinking that you will never get into stupid arguments is kind of naive. Only children think that everybody can simply get along with each other. The world just doesn’t work like that.\n\nYet, to be honest, I wanted - and want - that sort of relationship with that boy.\n\nA pure companionship.\n\nA pure love."
 VIETmisc.1015.desc.female:0 "Now I realize.\n\nI did love him after all.\n\nI wanted to be with him forever - silly, isn’t it? I thought he was the most wonderful person, the most perfect man."
 VIETmisc.1015.a.female:0 "Yet I never told him."
 VIETmisc.1016.desc.female:0 "Oh, wait now....\n\nNow I remember what he asked me.\n\nI can’t believe it. It’s so cliched. I should have remembered after all these years. He said it so randomly, so suddenly that day:"
 VIETmisc.1017.desc.female:0 "I didn’t answer him at the time. But if he were here now, and asked me that question again, what would I tell him? Would I answer "yes"?"
 VIETmisc.1018.desc.female:0 "And so I finally recall now why he was so angry.\n\nI didn’t give him any sort of proper response that day."
 VIETmisc.1019.desc.female:0 "Maybe all these years, he wondered whether that boy ever truly loved him. Maybe all these years.\n\nFrankly, it hurts me too, that I never gave him a proper answer."
 VIETmisc.1020.desc.female:0 "I wonder if he were here, now, what he would think. Would he even accept my resounding answer of "Yes!" to his question?\n\nI hope - and I only hope - that he would still think of me highly. I haven’t done many great things in life, but, then, nobody’s perfect. Back then, he always encouraged me to do my best."
 VIETmisc.1020.a.female:0 "I hope he is proud of me...."
 VIETmisc.1021.desc.female:0 "But he is no longer here. Even though we made up after the incident, we soon became adults and, of course, we soon parted afterwards - parted forever.\n\nIt was inevitable, I suppose. We were young. We didn't realize that our childhood wouldn't last forever.\n\nNothing lasts forever. Nothing bad, nothing good."
 VIETmisc.1022.desc.female:0 "But to this day, I still think of that silly boy. I still think of that stupid, silly way he smiled. I still think of those times we sat under that tree, side by side, our shoulders touching as we smiled and laughed and talked about nothing.\n\nMy friend.\n\nMy companion.\n\nMy inspiration.\n\nMy angel."

 VIETmisc.1045.desc:0 "Everyone says I should always get along with my sibling. Ha! Never! Sure, [scope_VIET_karen.GetSheHe] isn’t a bad person, but our relationship isn't perfect, as [scope_VIET_karen.GetSheHe] can be annoying at times. These past few days, for instance, [scope_VIET_karen.GetSheHe] has been insisting I do a certain favor for [scope_VIET_karen.GetHerHim]. It’s not an unreasonable favor, I admit, but why does it have to be me?"
 VIETmisc.1045.a:0 "Sorry, dear [scope_VIET_karen.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], but no."
 VIETmisc.1046.t:0 "An Odd Contest"
 VIETmisc.1046.desc:0 "My sibling [scope_VIET_karen.GetTitledFirstName] has been bothering me with that stupid favor again. At wit’s end, I think of a way to get rid of [scope_VIET_karen.GetHerHim]. I rummage through my possessions, trying to see if there’s anything of use. Threatening [scope_VIET_karen.GetHerHim] with a sword might be too drastic, for instance, and I don’t think bribing [scope_VIET_karen.GetHerHim] with gold would work either. Then, I see something and come up with an idea.\n\nLater, when [scope_VIET_karen.GetSheHe] approaches me again with the same request, I smile deviously, telling her that I will do the favor she asks… if, that is, she plays a “game” of my choosing."
 VIETmisc.1046.a:0 "“Sure,” [scope_VIET_karen.GetSheHe] says, “What could go wrong?”"
 VIETmisc.1047.t:0 "The Toothbrush"
 VIETmisc.1047.desc:0 "I return with a toothbrush, and tell [scope_VIET_karen.GetTitledFirstName] what game we’ll be playing: “I will brush your teeth, for, say, five minutes. If you can bear with it, then I’ll do as you wish.”\n\nWhen [scope_VIET_karen.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] looks at me incredulously, bewildered at why I would do this, I explain. “It is uncomfortable when someone touches your hair, no? Or when someone tickles you for that matter, right? Then if someone were to brush your teeth, it’d be extremely uncomfortable. Endure this discomfort for five minutes, and you win.”\n\nNow [scope_VIET_karen.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] understands, and laughs. Clearly, [scope_VIET_karen.GetSheHe] is confident [scope_VIET_karen.GetSheHe] can win this silly game. How naive!\n\nAfter [scope_VIET_karen.GetSheHe] sits down, I ready the toothbrush."
 VIETmisc.1047.a:0 ""Say aaaahhh!," I tell [scope_VIET_karen.GetHerHim]."
 VIETmisc.1048.t:0 "Uncomfortable"
 VIETmisc.1048.desc:0 "Without further ado, I lower the toothbrush, and begin brushing my sibling's teeth teeth. [scope_VIET_karen.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] whimpers a bit, but manages to stay composed. I can only continue grinning, knowing the worst is yet to come. Thin hairs are stimulating the most delicate, interior parts of [scope_VIET_karen.GetHerHis] body, so it will feel good - too good, in fact!\n\n"If you give up now, you'll feel good. Or, rather, you'll stop feeling good!"\n\nSuddenly, [scope_VIET_karen.GetSheHe] moans.\n\nI gulp. That moan sounded very strange. And as [scope_VIET_karen.GetSheHe] trembles under the discomfort - and pleasure - of the sensations, I, too, begin to feel strange."
 VIETmisc.1048.a:0 "Am I beginning to see [scope_VIET_karen.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] in a new light? Why does [scope_VIET_karen.GetSheHe] look so... inviting?"
 VIETmisc.1049.t:0 "Strange Sensations"
 VIETmisc.1049.desc:0 "As I continue moving the toothbrush back and forth in the mouth of [scope_VIET_karen.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], caressing [scope_VIET_karen.GetHerHis] teeth, stroking [scope_VIET_karen.GetHerHis] tongue, and other such things, and [scope_VIET_karen.GetHerHis] whimpers grow louder. My heart begins to beat wildly, and my face grows hot. This is a bad, this is bad!\n\nMy head grows dizzy, as I feel a strange passion overwhelm me. And I see it in [scope_VIET_karen.GetHerHis] eyes, too.\n\nI edge closer and closer to [scope_VIET_karen.GetHerHis], still brushing [scope_VIET_karen.GetHerHis] teeth, and gaze deeply into [scope_VIET_karen.GetHerHis] eyes. “[scope_VIET_karen.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]...” I murmur, unable to resist any longer."
 VIETmisc.1049.a:0 "My free hand moves closer... and closer... and...."
 VIETmisc.1050.t:0 "Interrupted"
 VIETmisc.1050.desc:0 "“What are you two doing?”\n\n[scope_VIET_karen.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and I jerk away from each other as one of my maids interrupts. Apparently the girl was passing by the room, and noticed the commotion. She adds, “What are you doing, [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], pushing your sibling down while [scope_VIET_karen.GetSheHe] is smiling? And what are you doing, [scope_VIET_karen.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], having a smile on your face while [scope_VIET_karen.GetSheHe] pushes you down?”\n\n“What a coincidence! What were we doing?” [scope_VIET_karen.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and I exclaim in unison, feigning ignorance and confusion.\n\nThe maid says, “I absolutely understand! I won’t say a thing!”\n\nAfter the maid scurries away, an awkward silence envelops the room.\n\nEventually, I speak. “Um... I think you won. That was certainly longer than five minutes. I’ll do that favor you want.”\n\n”Still,” [scope_VIET_karen.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] says, with a thoughtful look on [scope_VIET_karen.GetHerHis] face, “It feels unfair. Maybe we can make it best two out of three? I can brush your teeth this time.”"
 VIETmisc.1050.a:0 "“Sure,” I reply tersely. We watch each other warily for a moment, and then...."
 VIETmisc.1051.t:0 "Fraternal Love"
 VIETmisc.1051.desc:0 "And so, after that day, [scope_VIET_karen.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and I began to get along a little better."
 VIETmisc.1051.a:0 "Honestly, I don’t remember who won the contest or what the favor was."

 # THE DREAMER
 VIETmisc.8000.t:0 "Into Being"
 VIETmisc.8000.desc:0 "I open my eyes.\n\nThere is nothing around me… or… is there something? All I see is light. No, all I see is darkness. No… I…. The vision becomes clearer.\n\nI move my head around slowly. There is a large tree behind me, the lone tree in the meadow of green grass I stand in; its leaves’ shadows flicker across my face as I stare into the horizon. The sky is a hue of pale yellow, orange, and pink, as if the sun is setting, yet I cannot quite make out the sun in the distance.\n\nMy jumbled thoughts are interrupted when I see a [dreamer.GetWomanMan] standing far ahead. I feel no fear as the [dreamer.GetWomanMan], who has strange clothing and unusual hair in a style I am unfamiliar with, approaches. What a tall [dreamer.GetLadyLord], of glowing skin and handsome features, who possesses such regal eyes! For the longest time, [dreamer.GetSheHe] is silent, peering deep into my soul."
 VIETmisc.8000.a:0 "Finally, after what is an eternity, [dreamer.GetSheHe] speaks."
 VIETmisc.8001.t:0 "The Dreamer"
 VIETmisc.8001.desc:0 "This stranger’s voice is deep and calm, soothing yet carrying the power, the authority, that only the entirety of the cosmos can possess. And yet, [dreamer.GetHerHis] question is simple: “[ROOT.Char.GetFullName], is it?”\n\nI nod. I bow my head slightly. Though this [dreamer.GetLadyLord] has not told me her name yet, strangely, deep in my soul, I have learned what [dreamer.GetSheHe] is known as: the Dreamer.\n\n"Do you wish to go back?" the Dreamer asks. There is no sign of any emotion on [dreamer.GetHerHis] face, yet this does not worry me - this… neutrality is, I know, a sign of his deep, unending wisdom. "Do you remember the feeling now, so strongly, about wanting nothing more than to hear that song again, to feel that breeze against your face again, to see that bluest sky again?""
 VIETmisc.8001.a:0 "Yes."
 VIETmisc.8001.b:0 "No."
 VIETmisc.8002.t:0 "The World of Not Being"
 VIETmisc.8002.desc:0 ""I see." The Dreamer nods slowly and pauses for a moment. "Perhaps this is nothing but a pleasant dream, then. Perhaps we will see you again. Perhaps."\n\nI wake up.\n\nWhat… was that? I look around my bedroom, confused."
 VIETmisc.8002.a:0 "Perhaps…?"
 VIETmisc.8003.t:0 "The World of Being"
 VIETmisc.8003.desc:0 ""To bring you back to the past…. That is something we cannot do." The Dreamer points towards the horizon. There, in that direction, lies a faint glowing light. Had that always been there? I never noticed it before. "Over there… you may find the answer you seek. Perhaps."\n\nAn infinite amount of time later, I gradually blink my eyes open, feeling my soft bed underneath me.\n\nThe vision of that figure, that [dreamer.GetWomanMan], that [dreamer.GetLadyLord], is still seared into my mind."
