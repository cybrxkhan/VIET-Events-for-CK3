 VIETmonogatari.0001.t:0 "Qi Ma the Liar Arrives"
 VIETmonogatari.0001.desc:0 "I have heard that a most unusual traveler has arrived in the region. He is known as Qi Ma the Liar, and many claim he possesses unrivaled, unparalleled wisdom, even if some of his advice often refers to bizarre topics or makes little sense at times. Oddly, though many claim he is immensely famous, I have never heard of him before.\n\nStill, given he is known for his insights, perhaps I should pay him a visit sometime. Who knows what deep, intellectual subjects we might discuss? Even if he is a madman, maybe I could learn a thing or two. Then again, there are those who say I shouldn’t associate with those who refer to strange things."
 VIETmonogatari.0001.a:0 "I'll mull it over."
 VIETmonogatari.0001.tooltip:0 "For as long as you have the [character_modifier|E], #V Qi Ma the Liar is Nearby#!, you will have access to a [decision|E] to #V meet#! him. If you wish to seek his advice, you should do it as soon as you can - he won't be in town forever, and will sooner than later travel to elsewhere."

 VIETmonogatari.0003.t:0 "Qi Ma the Liar Leaves"
 VIETmonogatari.0003.desc:0 "I have received word that Qi Ma the Liar, that most eccentric yet wise traveler, who spoke in riddles and often referred to strange things, is no longer in the region. Rumor has it he is left to go search for some fabled, legendary calipers of immense power. Who knows when I will meet this fellow again?"
 VIETmonogatari.0003.a:0 "Maybe it's better that I didn't associate with those who refer to strange things."

 VIETmonogatari.0005.t:0 "Visiting Qi Ma the Liar"
 VIETmonogatari.0005.desc:0 "I arrive in the town where Qi Ma the Liar is staying, after I set up an appointment to meet with him. I find the tavern where he reportedly frequents, and enter it. It doesn't take me long to notice the elusive gentleman, and I walk over to where he is sitting.\n\nInsisting on speaking in the third person, he greets me while twirling his cat-like whiskers: “Qi Ma knows much, tells some. Qi Ma knows many things others do not.”"
 VIETmonogatari.0005.a:0 "Let’s see what this eccentric fellow knows."
 VIETmonogatari.0006.t:0 "Qi Ma the Liar Departs"
 VIETmonogatari.0006.desc:0 "I have received word that after I paid my visit to Qi Ma, that most eccentric yet wise traveler, he decided to pack up and travel to parts unknown. Rumor has it he left to go search for some fabled, legendary calipers of immense power. Who knows when I will meet this fellow again?"
 VIETmonogatari.0006.a:0 "He was a strange fellow."
 
 # Diplomacy
 VIETmonogatari.0100.t:0 "Beauty"
 VIETmonogatari.0100.desc:0 "Qi Ma says: “Qi Ma has heard that men and women all over the world look more attractive than they did in the past. He has no opinion on the matter. All people are beautiful to him.”"
 VIETmonogatari.0100.a:0 "Definitely, everyone is beautiful in their own way."
 VIETmonogatari.0100.b:0 "Some are objectively hideous. Let us not be too idealistic."
 VIETmonogatari.0101.t:0 "Where To Find Interesting Things?"
 VIETmonogatari.0101.desc:0 "Qi Ma says: “Qi Ma loves Frangistan, Hindustan, Iran, the Sahel, Rus.... Many interesting things happen in these places. Much more than in Cathay.”"
 VIETmonogatari.0101.a:0 "Why waste effort going to Cathay when we could focus on home?"
 VIETmonogatari.0101.b:0 "I wish to visit Cathay - it'll be like in my wild, crazy fantasies!"
 VIETmonogatari.0102.t:0 "Poor Taste in Chickens"
 VIETmonogatari.0102.desc:0 "Qi Ma says: "Qi Ma is always in search of good jokes about chickens, yet finds none. Where could they have gone?""
 VIETmonogatari.0102.a:0 "Perhaps some didn't like those jokes, so they're not popular anymore."
 VIETmonogatari.0102.b:0 "I like those kinds of jokes, and it’s sad they’re uncommon these days."

 # Martial
 VIETmonogatari.0200.t:0 "Crsauder Kings"
 VIETmonogatari.0200.desc:0 "Qi Ma says: “Qi Ma is not very impressed with the Crusader Kings. Many step in the Holy Land for only a few days before coming home to say they are a Crusader, yet everyone thinks this makes them better in the art of war!”"
 VIETmonogatari.0200.a:0 "I agree! Those people are not true warriors of God!"
 VIETmonogatari.0200.b:0 "I’m sure they earned their status as Crusaders fairly!"
 VIETmonogatari.0200.c:0 "I assure you I earned my status as a Crusader fairly!"
 VIETmonogatari.0200.d:0 "Those Crusaders are all devil-worshipping imposters!"
 VIETmonogatari.0201.t:0 "Transport"
 VIETmonogatari.0201.desc:0 "Qi Ma says: “Some people wish to build and sail on their own ships. That seems foolish to Qi Ma. Why waste time building ships, when you can sail on those built by others?”"
 VIETmonogatari.0201.a:0 "But everyone knows my soldiers cannot magically turn into boats."
 VIETmonogatari.0201.b:0 "You raise a good point, yes - I don’t care how the boats are made."
 VIETmonogatari.0202.t:0 "Too Much Effort"
 VIETmonogatari.0202.desc:0 "Qi Ma says: “Qi Ma doesn’t know why one would want to rid the entire world of baklava. It takes much time. Too much time.”"

 VIETmonogatari.0301.t:0 "Lies and Truth"
 VIETmonogatari.0301.desc:0 "Qi Ma says: “Some say the Romans have a feudal system of government. Some say Qi Ma is a Liar. Don't you believe either of those things!”"
 VIETmonogatari.0301.a:0 "To be honest, I am not sure whether to believe you or not."
 VIETmonogatari.0301.b:0 "Actually, here, our supreme executive power derives from…."
 VIETmonogatari.0302.t:0 "Stressful!"
 VIETmonogatari.0302.desc:0 "Qi Ma says: "Too much stress can be dangerous. Qi Ma once had too much stress and wasted money stuffing himself with baklava.""

 # Intrigue
 VIETmonogatari.0400.t:0 "Cancerous"
 VIETmonogatari.0400.desc:0 "Qi Ma says: “Something strange happens to children when they have too much intelligence, beauty, and strength. Some say this increases their chances of having cancer! Qi Ma is glad he is neither too intelligent, beautiful, nor strong.”"
 VIETmonogatari.0400.a:0 "There's always a catch to everything, isn't there?"
 VIETmonogatari.0401.t:0 "Parental Love"
 VIETmonogatari.0401.desc:0 "Qi Ma says: “So many kings kill their firstborn sons. Some say because he is not as intelligent as the second son. Some say because he is not as strong as the third son. Some say the daughter will make a better heir. Qi Ma is glad his parents loved him no matter what.”"
 VIETmonogatari.0401.a:0 "Um... I think my parents loved me too."
 VIETmonogatari.0402.t:0 "Marriage and Adultery"
 VIETmonogatari.0402.desc:0 "Qi Ma says: "Some men prefer to marry women who lust for other women, because they know they will never commit adultery with a man. Qi Ma thinks this is a practical, yet very depressing and lonely arrangement.""
 VIETmonogatari.0402.a:0 "It's important to know who's your heir - better safe than sorry!"
 VIETmonogatari.0402.b:0 "I agree! I’d rather risk it all for love than be lonely in marriage."

 # Learning
 VIETmonogatari.0500.t:0 "Demon Cults"

 VIETmonogatari.0502.t:0 "The Emperor"
 VIETmonogatari.0502.desc:0 "Qi Ma says: "You ask what the Emperor of China likes and dislikes? Qi Ma does not know anymore. There was once a time when everyone knew this. No one knows now. Perhaps it is for the better. Emperors have strange interests!""
 VIETmonogatari.0502.a:0 "I wonder if I could impress the Emperor of China with a gift?"
