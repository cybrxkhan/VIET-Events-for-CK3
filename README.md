# VIET Events for CK3

## Latest Version: 1.5.3 "Quilt" (Released 3/10/22)

_“Facing my wine, I did not see the dusk,
Falling blossoms have filled the folds of my clothes.
Drunk, I rise and approach the moon in the stream,
Birds are far off, people too are few.”_

_- ‘Amusing Myself’, by Li Bai_

_Li Bai was an 8th century poet, considered to have been one of the greatest Chinese poets alongside his friend Du Fu, even during his lifetime. Themes commonly found in his poetry include friendship, solitude, drinking, the moon, nature, and more._

Very Immersive Events and Tales (VIET), the sequel to VIET Events Reborn for CK2, is a flavor mod that adds a vast collection of events about everyday life to spice up your game. They add immersion and a diversity of experiences in between wars and vanilla’s event chains, and cover mundane minutiae ranging from small talk with courtiers and eating local cuisine to epic tales about love, philosophy, and the human condition. Some of the events unlock new decisions, character interactions, activities, and much more for you to explore!

I hope the lessons I learned from my eight years (with a hiatus) of modding CK2 will help me deliver a fun experience for any players interested in my mods. Lastly, please note that VIET is not achievement compatible.

Feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up.

## Features

- Over 800 new flavor events to experience!
- Explore new decisions, artifacts, character interactions, activities, and more!
- Game rule to disable sillier events for those who don't like them, with three levels to choose from: Balanced (Default), Serious (Restricted), and All Events (Full)
- Compatible with almost anything since it doesn't touch any vanilla files - even with overhaul mods, you can via game rule disable events that reference things specific to our medieval world that wouldn’t make sense in other time periods or universes (like fantasy and sci-fi conversion mods)
- Learn history with Historical Context tooltips that provide information about what inspired some of the events - sometimes, reality is stranger than fiction! (These can be disabled via game rule for those who find it immersion breaking.)


## Manual Installation Steps

DO NOT manually download the master branch unless you know what you're doing as it is the WIP version that is constantly being updated!

1. Go to https://github.com/cybrxkhan/VIET-Events-for-CK3/releases and find the latest version you wish to download.
2. Extract the .zip file to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod
3. Launch CKIII and select VIET Events in the launcher.
4. Enjoy and play!

NOTE: If you are re-installing a mod, delete the old version of the mod first before copy and pasting the new one! While it's not always necessary, it's a good habit to do to prevent any potential issues.
